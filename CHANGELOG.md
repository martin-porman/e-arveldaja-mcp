# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **CRM-MCP: `create_account`, `propose_account_deactivate`; the `crm` tool profile (18 tools).** `create_account` creates a chart-of-accounts account in the CRM as proposed (`POST /accounts`, prepare scope, no approval — the operator's own "creates it as proposed"); it always creates an active posting account, so `category` (one of the chart's 30 statement categories) is a required argument — the CRM refuses a posting account with no category, and the tool refuses locally before making a request when it is missing. `propose_account_deactivate` returns an approval-only card with a plan handle for `account.deactivate`; it never deactivates by itself — deactivation is execute-scope and gated by the CRM's own approval manifest, outside this fork. The new `crm` profile (auto-selected whenever `CRM_API_URL` is set; the only profile the CRM-MCP runs) is the guided 19 plus these two tools, minus `list_connections` / `switch_connection` / `get_setup_instructions` (a single fixed CRM connection needs no switching or setup instructions) = 18 tools. Switched off, with no CRM behaviour behind them: Wise and Lightyear tools (`process_bank_input`'s Wise branch now refuses explicitly); sale e-invoice delivery; series and bank-account administration; credential and connection tools; the `setup-*` workflows; product administration.

## [0.25.7] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- **`update_purchase_invoice` no longer 500s when items omit `cl_fringe_benefits_id`** ([#62](https://github.com/iseppo/e-arveldaja-mcp/issues/62)). `create_purchase_invoice` defaulted the field to 1 (no fringe benefit) but `update_purchase_invoice` sent items through verbatim, so the very payload that created an invoice failed on update with a raw `null value in column "cl_fringe_benefits_id" ... violates not-null constraint` from the API. The API GET also omits the field, so even header-only updates (which re-send the existing lines) were exposed. Update now applies the same structural item defaults as create (`cl_fringe_benefits_id` → 1, `amount` → 1, explicit values kept) to caller-supplied and re-sent items alike.

### Changed

- **Dependencies updated to current.** `@llamaindex/liteparse` 2.14.3 → 2.14.6, `zod` 4.5.4 → 4.6.5, plus dev tooling (`@babel/parser` 8.0.5, `@types/node` 26.6.1, `vite` 8.3.0). Declared floors raised to the tested versions per the dependency-floor policy. The eight `testdata/tool-surface/*.json` contract pins are byte-identical under zod 4.6, so no tool schema changed. `vitest` stays on 4.1.11: vitest 5 requires Node ≥ 22.12 while CI still runs the unit tests on Node 20. `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30.0 is still the latest release.

### Security

- **Cleared a moderate advisory in a transitive dependency.** `hono` below 4.13.5 (reached only through `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`'s HTTP transport, which this stdio-only server never loads) had a `toSSG()` path-escape, a `parseBody()` nesting DoS and a query-parser fragment issue (GHSA-gqvv-2mrq-wpjv, GHSA-g6gw-c38x-mqfc, GHSA-crvj-82cr-hjcx). The locked tree now resolves `hono` 4.13.8; `npm audit` reports zero known vulnerabilities.

### Added

- **Third-party payer protection for invoice receipts.** e-arveldaja copies the registration journal's client from the *bank transaction's* client (the payer), not from the linked invoice, and postings carry no client of their own — so when someone else pays an invoice (verified live: a ministry paying a foundation's invoice), the invoice is marked paid but the receivable credit lands in the payer's client sub-ledger and the invoice client keeps showing the debt. Four defences, no new tools:
  - **`TransactionsApi.confirm` refuses a mismatched confirm.** When the transaction already has a client and every invoice in the distribution belongs to one *different* client, the confirm is rejected before the register call with a structured `linked_invoice_client_mismatch` error (transaction and invoice client ids, `next_action`). The existing auto-fix for a *missing* client is unchanged.
  - **`confirm_transaction` gains `reassign_client_to_invoice`** (default false): the explicit, visible approval to replace the payer client on the transaction with the invoice's client before confirming. `bank_account_name` (the real payer) is never touched; the audit entry records `clients_id_before`/`clients_id_after`; the change is rolled back if the register call fails.
  - **Post-confirm ledger check.** After any invoice-linked confirm the registration journal is located (`operation_type = TRANSACTION`, `operations_id = transaction id` — the register call returns no journal id) and checked: exactly one journal, its client equals the invoice client, the bank leg and the receivable/payable leg carry the transaction amount on the accounts taken from the records. A failure is reported as `ledger_client_mismatch` / `ledger_posting_mismatch` / `registration_journal_not_found` with `mutation_occurred: true` and the repair steps (invalidate, then confirm again with `reassign_client_to_invoice`); the confirm itself is never silently reported as a clean success. `reconcile_bank_transactions` exact-confirm runs the same check once for the whole batch and reports `ledger_checks`.
  - **Exact-match reconciliation routes third-party payers to review.** A unique exact match whose transaction client differs from the invoice client (or whose invoice has no client) is no longer auto-confirmed; it becomes a `third_party_payer_reviews` row in the plan (with `transaction_clients_id`, `invoice_clients_id` and the exact repair command), the invoice stays reserved, and the plan fingerprint covers the review set so a changed set is plan drift. `suggest` rows flag the same case with `manual_review_required`.
  - **`run_accounting_report` mode `receipt_client_alignment`** (read-only): scans confirmed invoice-linked transactions, reports every payer/invoice client mismatch with the registration journal id, both clients and the literal repair steps, and separately lists confirmed receipts whose registration journal cannot be found. Nothing is mutated.
  A one-client-per-journal reclassification entry (Dr 1210 payer / Cr 1210 invoice client) is not expressible in e-arveldaja, so the repair path is invalidate → reassign → re-confirm, which stays traceable.

- **Wrong-company write protection for multi-connection servers** ([#61](https://github.com/iseppo/e-arveldaja-mcp/issues/61)). The active connection lives only in the server process, so an MCP host that respawns the server (crash, idle timeout, reconnect) silently starts it back on the default connection — and a write intended for company B lands in company A's books. Two defences:
  - **`EARVELDAJA_DEFAULT_CONNECTION`** (index or exact connection name) pins which connection a fresh process starts on; an unknown value fails startup instead of falling back to index 0. The startup log line now also names the active connection.
  - **Optional `connection` argument on every non-readonly tool** when more than one connection is configured (index, numeric string, or name as shown by `list_connections`). A call whose `connection` does not name the active connection is refused with a structured `connection_mismatch` error *before any API request*, so callers can assert the target company on every write instead of trusting session state. Single-connection servers keep their schemas unchanged (the tool-surface contract pins are untouched); `switch_connection` and read-only tools never carry the argument.

## [0.25.6] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **Opaque receipt `file_ref` values reopen on real macOS filesystems.** The 0.25.2 hardening assumed `realpath("/dev/fd/N")` returned the receipt directory's canonical pathname on Darwin. Node 24 and 26 instead return a synthetic `/dev/fd/<directory-name>` path while `readdir("/dev/fd/N")` remains `ENOTDIR`, so the descriptor was rejected and every opaque receipt reference failed with `file_reference_path_changed`. A successfully resolved Darwin `/dev/fd/N` now keeps the descriptor requirement without comparing its synthetic spelling to the canonical pathname; enumeration still uses the canonical path guarded by opened-object identity checks.

### Changed

- **Dependencies updated to current.** `@llamaindex/liteparse` 2.13.1 → 2.14.3, `fast-xml-parser` 5.11.0 → 5.11.1, `zod` 4.4.3 → 4.5.4, plus dev tooling (`@types/node`, `tsx`). Declared floors raised to the tested versions per the dependency-floor policy. `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` stays at 1.30.0, which is still the latest published release.
- **Nullable tool-schema fields are now emitted as a JSON Schema type array.** zod 4.5 spells an optional-nullable as `"type": ["number", "null"]` where 4.4 emitted `"anyOf": [{"type": "number"}, {"type": "null"}]`. Both are valid JSON Schema 2020-12 and every affected field keeps exactly the same accepted values, so no tool input that validated before is rejected now — but the schemas an MCP client receives do change, which is why the eight `testdata/tool-surface/*.json` contract pins were regenerated rather than relaxed. The regenerated pins were diffed field-by-field against the old ones under a normalization that rewrites the new spelling back to the old: tool counts, tool names, descriptions, prompts and resources are byte-identical across all eight profiles, and only the nullable spelling moved. The encoding is marginally smaller — the default profile's `tools/list` drops from 122 412 to 122 355 bytes; the two guided profiles have no nullable fields and are unchanged.

### Security

- **Per-file receipt binding no longer depends on descriptor `realpath` spelling.** Every opened receipt is now checked by filesystem object identity (`fstat` on the `O_NOFOLLOW` handle versus `stat` on the canonical file path) before its bytes are read. This keeps the per-file check active on Darwin's canonical-path fallback, preserves descriptor-relative access elsewhere, and applies the same opened-object check to direct folder paths.
- **Cleared a high and a moderate advisory in transitive dependencies.** `fast-uri` below 3.1.6 has host-confusion and SSRF issues via IDN canonicalization, IPv6 normalization and repeated percent-decoding (GHSA-5jgf-p345-68v8, GHSA-f65p-4m7j-42xc, GHSA-fph4-wmhf-6fwf, GHSA-jqff-g426-hqxp), and `qs` below 6.16.0 has an array-limit bypass and an attacker-controlled `isBuffer` denial of service (GHSA-x5fp-wj9c-mxmx, GHSA-4mjr-xmp4-gh2g). Both reach this package only through `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` — `fast-uri` under `ajv`, `qs` under `express`. Neither was exploitable here: the server runs on `StdioServerTransport` only, so the SDK's HTTP transport and its `express` query parsing are never loaded. The locked tree now resolves `fast-uri` 3.1.7 and `qs` 6.16.0; no declared dependency range changed to get there, and `npm audit` reports zero known vulnerabilities.

## [0.25.5] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **Dependencies updated to current.** `@llamaindex/liteparse` 2.9.0 → 2.13.1, `fast-xml-parser` 5.10.1 → 5.11.0, `@toon-format/toon` 4.1.0 → 4.1.1, plus dev tooling (`tsx`, `vite`, `vitest`, `@types/node`). Declared floors raised to the tested versions per the dependency-floor policy. `npm audit` remains at zero known vulnerabilities.

## [0.25.4] - 2026-08-20

### Security

- **Updated vulnerable transitive dependencies.** The locked dependency tree now resolves `fast-uri` 3.1.5, `hono` 4.13.2, and `nanoid` 3.3.18, addressing the host-confusion, request-processing, and zero-size generator denial-of-service advisories reported by `npm audit`. No direct dependency ranges changed, and the refreshed tree reports zero known vulnerabilities.

## [0.25.3] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **`extract_pdf_invoice` could crash with `getDocumentParser(...).isComplex is not a function`.** The declared range for `@llamaindex/liteparse` started at `^2.0.4`, but `isComplex` — called on the first parse of every PDF — only exists from 2.2.0. Any install whose tree resolved below that, most often a cached `npx` directory holding an older 2.x that still satisfied the range, crashed on the first document with a bare `TypeError` naming nothing useful. This repo's own lockfile pinned a working version, so neither development nor CI ever reproduced it. The floor now sits at the version the suite is actually exercised against, and the parser is checked at construction so a future mismatch reports the dependency, the required version, and that an npx cache may need clearing instead of failing as a missing method. Present since 0.19.0, not a 0.25.x regression.

### Changed

- **Dependencies updated to current.** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.29.0 → 1.30.0, `@llamaindex/liteparse` 2.5.0 → 2.9.0, `@toon-format/toon` 2.3.0 → 4.1.0, `@babel/parser` 7 → 8 (dev), plus `tsx` and `vite`. The TOON major shortens the encoding of the response shapes that dominate a session: the 100-item accounting-inbox response drops from 31 563 to 14 579 bytes, the 20-item from 6 394 to 3 090, and the plan pages by 128 each. Under 2.3.0 the accounting-inbox encoding was *larger* than the JSON it replaced (6 394 vs 6 061 bytes) — it now costs half. Response payloads still round-trip byte-for-byte; the encode/decode check in `toMcpJson` and its JSON fallback are unchanged, and the byte baselines in `testdata/context-budgets.json` were regenerated to match.

### Security

- **Closed a moderate advisory in a transitive dependency.** `@hono/node-server` below 2.0.5 has a path-traversal issue in `serve-static` on Windows via an encoded backslash (GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9), and it reached this package through the MCP SDK. It was not exploitable here — the server runs on `StdioServerTransport` only, so the HTTP static-file path is never loaded — and the advisory could not be cleared locally: `npm audit fix --force` proposed *downgrading* the SDK to 1.24.3, and the fixed hono is a major beyond the range the SDK itself declared. SDK 1.30.0 moves to `@hono/node-server` 2.x, so the tree is now clean (`npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities) without pinning anything out of range.

## [0.25.2] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **Opaque receipt `file_ref` values never resolved on macOS.** Node exposes a directory handle at `/dev/fd/N` there, but the path is not traversable — `readdir` on it fails with `ENOTDIR` — so every reference reopened against a receipt folder was rejected with `file_reference_path_changed`, making the whole opaque-reference flow unusable on that platform. Directory enumeration now falls back to the canonical pathname on Darwin, guarded by the before/after opened-object identity checks a direct `folder_path` call already relies on. Thanks to @Ozzuke for finding and diagnosing this (#56).

### Security

- **The macOS fallback no longer waives the descriptor requirement for opaque references.** As contributed, the fix also let an opaque reference proceed on Darwin when *no* descriptor namespace resolved at all. That case is not what the macOS bug needs — `realpath` on `/dev/fd` succeeds there, only `readdir` fails — and it is the one case where `readBoundReceiptFile` skips its per-file opened-object verification, which is gated on a descriptor path being present. An opaque reference would then have been checked strictly less than the direct call it is meant to be stronger than. The requirement is restored on every platform, and a regression test pins that macOS fails closed when no descriptor namespace resolves; the per-file `O_NOFOLLOW` open and canonical-path check are unchanged.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **`book_lightyear_trades` rejected every fee-bearing buy, and would have mis-booked them.** Lightyear reports the fee *inside* `Gross Amount` — `Net Amt.` is `Gross − Fee` for buys and sells alike — on a buy the gross is the cash spent and the net the share consideration, on a sell the gross is the consideration and the net the cash received. The trade validator instead required `Net = Gross + Fee` on a buy, so any buy carrying a platform fee failed with `trade_amount_conflict` and was silently left for manual booking (a real statement set contained 107 such buys, every one of them `Gross − Fee`, none `Gross + Fee`). The same inverted assumption sat in the buy posting builder, which added the trade fee to an `eur_amount` that already contained it: had the validator alone been relaxed, a 100.00 EUR purchase would have been booked as 99.75 to the investment account and 100.10 out of the broker account — cash that never moved. A regression test books a verbatim real fee-bearing USD buy with its conversion pair and pins the postings to the conversion leg's own gross, fee and net.
- **The buy trade fee is now expensed rather than capitalised into the investment account.** Three things agree on this and the old behaviour contradicted all of them: RTJ 3 expenses transaction costs on financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, which is where exchange-quoted equities land; the sell path already expensed its own trade fee to the same account; and Lightyear's capital-gains report relieves cost at a fee-**exclusive** `Cost Basis (EUR)`, with its `Fees (EUR)` column carrying only the sell fee. Capitalising the fee on the way in while relieving a fee-exclusive basis on the way out stranded the fee on the investment account permanently. A 1002.50 EUR buy with a 2.50 fee now posts 1000.00 to the investment account, 2.50 to the fee account and 1002.50 out of the broker account.
- **Fee-bearing FX sells never found their currency conversion.** The same inverted assumption decided which conversion belongs to a trade. A conversion is built around the cash that actually moves in the trade's currency — for a buy that is the gross it spends, but for a sell it is only the net it receives, the fee having already been taken out. Both matchers (the statement's conversion pairing and the reservation index that keeps trade conversions away from distribution extraction) compared against the gross in either direction, so a sell whose statement recorded a 99.90 conversion was searched for as 100.00 and rejected with `invalid_conversion_pair`. Of 61 fee-bearing FX sells in the real statement set, 17 pair under the corrected basis where none did before. The column choice lives in one helper used by both matchers, and buys are unaffected. Pairing alone does not make these sells bookable — the capital-gains cross-check compares Lightyear's ECB-rate `Proceeds (EUR)` against the dealt-rate euros actually received, a pre-existing gap this release does not close — so both the pairing and the remaining skip are pinned by regression tests built from verbatim real rows.
- **`parse_lightyear_statement` and `lightyear_portfolio_summary` reported a cost basis the ledger never booked.** Both added the trade fee to the invested amount while the posting builder now subtracts it, so the same statement produced 99.75 in the summary against a 99.55 investment debit in the journal — and the portfolio tool is documented as the way to verify the investment-account balance. Both are now on the ledger's basis. The portfolio summary additionally subtracted the trade fee from FX sell proceeds even though `eur_amount` is the already-net cash the conversion delivered, double-counting it; on a real BRK.B disposal that understated proceeds and the realised result by 0.91 EUR. Proceeds and cost are now both stated fee-exclusive, matching `Capital Gains = Proceeds − Cost Basis` in Lightyear's own report.
- **The tool description and the `lightyear-booking` workflow prompt still promised the old capitalising behaviour.** Both stated that a buy's trade platform fee is capitalised into the investment cost and is NOT posted to `fee_account`, which is what an agent reads before choosing accounts — so the two public contracts contradicted the postings the tool now produces. Both now say every buy and sell fee, platform and FX alike, is expensed, and the generated `.claude/commands/lightyear-booking.md` mirror was re-synced.
- The buy branch of the cent-overflow guard now guards the two sums the buy postings actually perform (`eur_amount − trade_fee` and `eur_amount + fx_fee`); previously it guarded the sell branch's pair, whose second sum (`trade_fee + fx_fee`) a buy never computes.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- **Explicit MCP tool profiles and exhaustive catalog metadata.** `EARVELDAJA_PROFILE=guided|guided-sales|standard|full` selects a server-scoped public surface; absent profile preserves the standard surface, `full` preserves the complete surface, and legacy exposure flags normalize to `custom`. Guided surfaces are opt-in (19 tools; 20 with the `manage_sale_invoice` sales façade). Tool metadata, destructive parity, public-name uniqueness, facade/granular references, and full-surface set equality now fail closed.
- **Profile-bound safety and setup persistence.** Runtime execution plans and file references bind the normalized profile plus catalog fingerprint. Credential import can store a validated profile in the same selected local/global `.env`; a reviewed named-profile selection also lists and removes legacy exposure keys there, including for profile-only updates to an already-stored credential. Guided structured actions that require an unavailable advanced tool preserve a non-executable accounting proposal, return `advanced_action_unavailable_in_profile`, and expose only `get_setup_instructions`; switching profiles always requires a fresh preview.
- **`get_server_status` tool.** A compact read-only tool that reports the running server version, the active tool profile, and any active point-of-use release notices. Needs no credentials and is registered unconditionally (like `get_setup_instructions`); it belongs to no opt-out feature group, so it is visible in `standard` / `full` (and setup mode) but not the guided surfaces. This raises the standard surface to 127 tools and the full surface to 147.
- **Guided daily-bookkeeping journey completeness.** Five gaps where the guided / guided-sales profiles previously dead-ended on an everyday task (forcing a drop to `standard`) are closed by extending existing guided entry points — no new guided tools, so the ≤ 20 guided surface is unchanged:
  - `process_accounting_document` gains `mode='confirm'` — confirm (register) the DRAFT purchase invoice a prior document-intake step left behind, closing the loop from receipt to a confirmed entry without leaving the guided surface. Plan-gated (consume-once handle drift-bound to the invoice id).
  - `run_accounting_report` gains `report='missing_documents'` — the RPS source-document audit (journals / transactions / purchase / sale invoices with no attached document) is now reachable as a guided report. The standalone `find_missing_documents` output is unchanged (shared core, byte-identical).
  - `search_accounting_records` gains a `query` filter for `entity='clients'` — fuzzy find-a-customer/supplier by name; when set, all matches return in one page. Names are desandboxed at the lookup boundary so a name round-tripped from a wrapped read still matches.
  - `manage_sale_invoice` gains `action='recurring'` — clone the previous month's confirmed sale invoices into DRAFT recurring invoices from the guided-sales façade, under the same two-call prepare/execute plan-handle gate (drift-bound to the recurring params). The standalone `create_recurring_sale_invoices` output is unchanged (shared core).
  - `manage_sale_invoice action='create'` gains inline resolve-or-create customer — pass a `client` object (`name`, `reg_code?`, `vat_no?`, `iban?`, `country?`) instead of `clients_id` and the customer is resolved (or created) through the existing supplier-resolution primitive with all its guards intact (self-match, strong-identifier conflict, the P17 legal-entity identity gate). If the customer cannot be unambiguously resolved or created, neither the client nor the invoice is created; inline-created customers are correctly labelled `is_client`.

### Changed

- **`continue_accounting_workflow` is now a mutating tool — standard-surface contract change.** It gains `action='execute_review_action'` and a `plan_handle` input, and its annotation flips from read-only to mutating (`readOnlyHint: true → false`), so the change is visible on the `standard` (and `guided` / `guided-sales` / `full`) tool surface. Previously an owner-paid-expense-reimbursement review item dead-ended in the guided profiles because the suggested `create_owner_expense_reimbursement` / `create_journal` tools are invisible there. Now `action='prepare_action'` on such an item mints a consume-once plan handle bound to the reviewed booking params (instead of projecting an unavailable-tool blocker), and `action='execute_review_action'` with that handle books the owner-expense journal. The mutation is narrowly scoped: it is reachable **only** through `execute_review_action` with a handle that is consumed before any API call and drift-bound (`canonicalPlanJson`) to the reviewed params — replay, missing / expired / wrong-scope / wrong-domain handles, and drifted params all fail closed with zero side effect, and a non-owner-expense action returns a clear not-server-executable error and books nothing. `next` / `resolve_review` / `prepare_action` remain read-only for every other review type. The owner-expense booking core is shared with `create_owner_expense_reimbursement`, whose output stays byte-identical; the receipt/OCR-origin expense description is re-wrapped as untrusted text at the continuation's own output boundary.

- **Reduced fixed MCP instruction context.** The per-session `instructions` string (loaded on every session) was trimmed from 2191 bytes to well under the 1.5 KiB target by moving detailed VAT / reverse-charge, bank-transaction direction, and reporting-accuracy guidance into the owning `workflows/*.md` prompts (`book-invoice`, `import-camt`, `import-wise`, `company-overview`, `month-end`). The string is now built by a dedicated `src/server/server-instructions.ts` and still carries the six durable invariants (live-data warning, preview/approval unless read-only, external-text evidence rule, guided entry points, connection isolation, currency default).
- **Point-of-use release notices.** The v0.22.0 incoming-direction regression advisory moved out of the global instructions into a static, flow-scoped release notice (`src/server/release-notices.ts`) surfaced only at the start of the affected bank flows (CAMT / Wise) via `process_bank_input`, never in unrelated sessions. Notices carry a stable id and an active window, and are emitted unwrapped as first-party release text.

### Fixed

- **The guided profiles could never execute a Wise import.** `process_bank_input mode='execute'` requires the exact `approved_command_digest`, but the guided profiles render Wise only through the compact presenter, which emitted the plan handle and no digest — and `import_wise_transactions`, the only other emitter, is not registered there. Execute rejected with `digest_mismatch` and advised a new dry run, which produced another digest-less summary, so the statement could not be booked at all. The compact dry-run summary now returns the complete execute call (`next_action`) carrying both approval artifacts. The gate itself is unchanged: the digest is an approval artifact the caller echoes back, and both it and the plan handle are still required. CAMT was unaffected (plan handle only). A statement supplied as an inline `base64:` payload cannot have its source echoed back (it can be megabytes, and the full envelope omits it for the same reason), so on that path the summary message states that the caller must add the source to the next call alongside the approval artifacts.
- **Post-mutation failures no longer report that nothing was written.** Guided façades dropped the operation layer's `retry` signal and hardcoded `mutation_occurred: false` on the generic failure branch, with a single hardcoded exception. But `invoice_creation_failed` and `invoice_id_missing` are raised only *after* the purchase invoice exists, and `client_rollback_indeterminate` / `invoice_create_failed_client_rolled_back` only after a customer record does — so a failed totals PATCH left an active draft, or a failed compensating deactivation left an active customer, while the response denied any write. Since the plan handle is burned before validation (one-attempt semantics), that response is the operator's only record. Operation failures now carry an explicit `mutationOccurred` flag plus the ids of the records they wrote, and every façade renders failures through one shared projection that also preserves `retry`.
- **CAMT split-entry legs are no longer collapsed as duplicates of each other.** An `<Ntry>` with several `<TxDtls>` is split across its legs by booked amount — the legs are parts of one total, never copies. The batch duplicate key had no per-leg discriminator, so equal-amount legs whose per-leg detail the bank does not populate collided and every leg after the first was dropped: an aggregated 150.00 EUR payment with three ref-less 50.00 legs booked 50.00, and a 50.00 entry split across two legs booked 25.00. The key now carries the leg ordinal. Separate entries are all leg 0, so cross-entry deduplication is unchanged (covered by a new test).
- **Wise no longer drops distinct transactions that merely look alike.** The duplicate signature omits direction and the Wise ID, and planned rows were folded into the stored-row set mid-run, so within one statement the second of two identical same-day card payments, an incoming refund matching a same-day outgoing payment, and the second of two identical Wise fees were all silently skipped — under-booking the account. Within a statement the Wise ID is now the identity (it already was, via `seenWiseIds`); planned rows no longer poison the duplicate set, and the execute-time staleness precondition no longer treats a differently-identified `WISE:`-tagged row as evidence that the command already ran. Matching against previously stored rows additionally respects the recorded direction when the row carries an explicit `[source_direction=…]` marker; unmarked and legacy rows keep the previous match-anything behaviour, so no re-import can be introduced.
- **Recurring-invoice runs no longer lose already-created clones on a mid-loop read failure.** The per-source `saleInvoices.get` sat outside the try/catch guarding create/confirm, so a transient upstream error threw past the handler and discarded the whole `results` array — including clones already created and registered, whose ids then appeared nowhere in the response. The read now degrades to a per-row error like the create/confirm failures do.
- **The Accounting Inbox no longer leaks execution-plan slots.** Every receipt-batch dry run minted two consume-once handles, but the inbox/autopilot consumer reads only the summary and discards them. The plan store throws at capacity instead of evicting and holds entries for ten minutes, so repeated inbox scans could fill it and make every other approval path fail to mint a handle. That path now previews without minting; explicit `receipt_batch` dry runs are unchanged.
- **A `needs_input` document preview no longer hands back a usable create credential.** A booking-binding `process_accounting_document mode='prepare'` minted the create plan handle as soon as booking fields were present, without regard to whether the supplier had resolved or a blocker stood. The preview could therefore report `needs_input` and tell the operator to resolve the supplier before booking, while returning a handle that `mode='create'` accepted. The two states genuinely diverge — a transient `clients.listAll` failure is swallowed, so the preview's own resolution falls through to not-found while the effective booking still resolves the supplier through `clients.get`. The handle is now issued only for a preview that is actually approvable, matching the sale-invoice façade; the bound booking projection is still returned for review.
- **Balance-sheet and profit-and-loss reports no longer truncate silently.** In the default `detail='compact'` mode `run_accounting_report` capped each section at 25 lines but discarded the truncation flag, and neither result type carries a line count — so a chart with more accounts than the cap produced a complete-looking statement whose own lines did not sum to its own (correct, untruncated) total, with nothing marking the omission. Each capped section now reports `truncated`, alongside a top-level marker and note, as `trial_balance` and the aging buckets already did.
- **`import_wise_transactions` described the 0.22.0 regression as its contract.** The tool description claimed "every created bank row uses API type C", the exact behaviour that booked incoming rows backwards, while the code correctly maps incoming → `D` and outgoing → `C`. As the only Wise contract in `tools/list`, it could have led an agent to "correct" a correct ledger straight back into the regression. The description now states the directional mapping, and a test pins it.
- **Reconciliation no longer scores a one-cent gap as an exact amount match.** `Math.abs(a - b) < 0.01` survived the integer-cents migration in the candidate scorer and the inter-account matcher, and float subtraction made it magnitude-dependent: `10.00` vs `10.01` differ by 0.00999… and passed as equal, while `100.00` vs `100.01` differ by 0.01000… and did not. The lenient case is the dangerous one — combined with a reference and client match it reaches 95 and auto-confirms a one-cent-off invoice as fully settled. Both sites now compare exact integer cents ("equal to the cent", not "within a cent"); the sub-1-EUR `close_amount` band stays a genuine tolerance, and a non-finite amount is guarded so that it scores no match, as before, rather than letting the new integer conversion throw out of the run.
- **Recurring receipt totals no longer carry another currency's label.** `receipt_batch` voted the totals currency over *every* scanned row while summing only the reliably processed ones, so rows contributing nothing to the figure could still name it — three USD receipts held for review plus two booked EUR ones reported the EUR-only sum labelled `USD`. The label is now voted over exactly the summed rows, and when those rows genuinely disagree the response says so rather than picking a plurality.
- **Wise `in_total` / `out_total` no longer present a cross-currency sum as one figure.** They are plain sums of the row amount, so a statement mixing 100 USD and 50 EUR rendered an unlabelled `150` on the approval card. The totals now carry their currency when every summed row agrees — fee rows included, which are synthesised and carry no CSV line to read a currency from, yet do land in `out_total` — and warn plainly when they do not. Execute rebuilds the created-row list rather than reusing the preview's, so both fee paths (confirmed, and created-but-confirm-failed) carry the currency too; otherwise the executed card and the dry-run card would disagree about the same import. The ledger was never affected — this is the figure the operator approves against.
- **A Wise `eur_legacy_autofix` candidate can no longer be raised from a non-EUR-funded row.** The branch compared a confirmed invoice's EUR gross against the row's `sourceAmount` and treated the result as EUR, which only holds when the row was funded in EUR — the sibling `foreign_currency_lock` branch checks that, this one assumed it. Whenever the pair rate sat within ~0.1% of 1.0 the difference slipped under the 10-cent window and the candidate proposed overwriting the invoice's `gross_price` with a foreign-currency number relabelled EUR (rate 1). The funding-currency guard is now explicit.
- **A large receipt folder no longer loses the record of what it created.** One file reference is minted per file and the store throws at capacity rather than evicting (so a live approval reference is never silently invalidated), but the same call site runs *after* the create mutation — so a folder past the cap replaced the report of which invoices were created with an exception. Per-file references now degrade to absent, keeping every other field; a malformed path still fails loudly. A scan, which runs before anything is written, additionally reports how many references it could not issue and why, so an unactionable row is never silently unactionable.
- **The sale-invoice approval card shows the values it binds.** `boundPayloadProjection` dropped every string, so an `action='send'` preview showed `send_einvoice: true` and never the address it would go to — the operator approved a delivery without seeing the destination. The value was bound in the fingerprint all along (execute could not change it); the card just refused to show it. Bound string scalars are now shown, sandbox-wrapped and length-capped.
- **Failure envelopes state their `retry` disposition consistently.** Hand-built payloads outside the four façades dropped the field, so a caller could not tell "do not retry" from "unknown". Where the operations layer already computed a value (CAMT, reconciliation) it is now carried through instead of discarded; plan-gate and input-validation envelopes state `never` explicitly; and a file-input snapshot failure distinguishes the one code that may succeed on a retry (`file_input_unavailable`) from the three that describe a mismatch the caller must fix first. Plan-execution command records are deliberately untouched — their key set is validated exactly.

### Security

- **`manage_sale_invoice` now binds the full mutation payload into the two-call plan handle.** Previously a prepared `create` / `update` / `send` plan bound only `{action, invoice_id}`, so an approved preview could be executed with a different payload (different amounts, line items, send channel/recipients, or inline customer). The plan fingerprint now includes the desandboxed payload (identity-only for the inline `client`), so executing a changed payload against a prepared handle fails closed with `plan_drift` and zero side effect. Callers must present the same payload at `prepare` and `execute`. Inline customer creation was also reordered to run account/dimension validation **before** creating the customer (no orphan client on a validation failure), and supplying both `clients_id` and an inline `client` is now a hard `client_input_conflict` error instead of silently ignoring the inline identity guards.
- **`process_accounting_document` mode='create' now requires a `plan_handle`.** Create must follow a `mode='prepare'` in the same scope, giving mandatory consume-once replay + scope protection (the reviewed document bytes are still bound by `source_sha256`); a create with no prepared handle is refused with `plan_handle_required` before any mutation. Operator OCR corrections at create time remain supported.
- **`process_accounting_document` create plan now binds the FULL canonical booking model (P0).** An extraction-only `mode='prepare'` no longer mints a create handle — an OCR preview is never create approval. A prepare given the final reviewed booking fields computes the canonical effective write model server-side (supplier canonical name read from the server, items after parse → desandbox → VAT defaults → dimension validation, all defaults applied) and binds its fingerprint into the plan; `mode='create'` recomputes the same model **fresh** and byte-compares before the first API write, so no material field — source bytes, supplier, invoice number, dates, items, accounts, dimensions, VAT config, totals, currency/rate/base amounts, liability account, references, notes, duplicate policy — can change between review and execution (`plan_drift`, zero writes).
- **Transaction-classification execute no longer trusts caller `classifications_json` (P0).** `dry_run_apply` re-fetches live transactions, resolves suppliers/bookings server-side and mints a consume-once, scope-bound plan whose fingerprint binds per-transaction live state (status, amount, base amount, currency, rate, date, bank dimension, client), category, apply mode, the resolved booking projection and the exact create/confirm/link command list. `execute_apply` requires the handle, re-derives everything fresh and rejects `plan_drift` before the first write; a grouped transaction that disappeared or was confirmed meanwhile stops the whole affected command. Caller JSON can only select among plan entries, never author them.
- **Receipt-batch execution is no longer approved by the file manifest alone (P0).** `dry_run` now mints one consume-once plan handle per execution effect (`create` vs `create_and_confirm`), each binding the canonical manifest, folder/file identity, receipt and transaction date filters, the bank dimension, every file's final supplier/booking projection, the linked live bank-transaction state and the command list. Execute re-snapshots the files, re-checks the manifest, recomputes the fingerprint fresh and consumes the matching handle before any mutation — the same manifest with a different dimension, date range, booking or escalated confirm mode fails closed, and a `create` approval can never be replayed as `create_and_confirm`.
- **Recurring sale invoices state their real execution effect in the preview (P1).** The dry run now reports `execution_effect` (`create_drafts` vs `create_and_confirm`), `auto_confirm`, `would_create` / `would_confirm` counts and per-row `would_create_draft` / `would_create_and_confirm` / `would_skip_existing` statuses, and warns that `auto_confirm=true` registers invoices straight into the ledger; the execute result carries the same effect.
- **Owner-expense continuation approval shows and binds the complete journal (P1).** `continue_accounting_workflow`'s owner-expense prepare resolves the whole effective journal — VAT deduction mode, deductible/non-deductible split, VAT account, document number and the full debit/credit postings — before minting the handle, shows it on the approval card, and execute re-derives it fresh with a canonical drift compare, so a changed VAT mode or account rejects with zero writes.
- **Inline sale-invoice customer creation can no longer orphan master data.** If the customer was created inline and the invoice create then fails, the client is rolled back (deactivated) or, when the rollback itself is uncertain, a structured indeterminate result names the created client id and the exact next action.
- **Strict calendar-date validation everywhere operator dates enter.** A shared parser (`src/strict-date.ts`) enforces real calendar dates (leap years included) in canonical `YYYY-MM-DD` form across the guided façades, importers and the recurring flow — `2026-02-29`, `2026-02-31`, `2026-13-01`, `2026-1-1` and inverted ranges are rejected before any plan handle is consumed.
- **Response paging and workflow-state hardening.** Stores reject a single detail larger than the page hard budget at insertion time with a structured error (nothing silently unreachable), the standard/full plan pager gains the hard-budget check it lacked, guided workflow responses only mint paging handles when there are pageable items (no more store exhaustion from item-less calls), and both paging entrypoints share one cursor signer so a cursor from either is valid at the other.
- **Tool risk metadata matches real mutation capability.** `continue_accounting_workflow` is catalogued as mutating (not preview/read) and the registrar cross-checks every tool's `readOnlyHint` against its catalog risk.
- **`execute_year_end_close` surfaces partial mutation.** A closing-journal create failure mid-run returns a structured `partial` result naming the already-created draft journal ids and the concrete next action instead of a bare error.
- **Truthful confirm receipts.** The `process_accounting_document` confirm receipt claims only what the post-register read-back actually returned (supplier + gross, only supplier, only labelled amount, or id-only) and never shows an amount without its currency.
- **Attacker-controlled counterparty text no longer reaches the model unsandboxed through classification output.** `classify_unmatched_transactions` and `classify_bank_transactions mode='analyze'` wrap `display_counterparty` and the per-transaction fields, but copied `review_guidance` through unwrapped — and that guidance interpolates the counterparty into the very sentence the model is told to put to the operator. A remitter controls `bank_account_name` on an inbound bank row, so no file supply was needed. The counterparty is now sandboxed and length-capped where it enters the prose. `apply_transaction_classifications` / `mode='dry_run_apply'` had the same exposure through raw `counterparty` and through the note prose that interpolates it. The scalar `counterparty` is wrapped at the output site; the one note that embeds the counterparty sandboxes just that span where it enters the sentence, so the server-authored guidance around it stays readable. The per-group failure note, which echoes a raw upstream error body back after calls carrying counterparty-derived values, is sandboxed the same way. Note prose is deliberately *not* fenced wholesale — a new `notes.push` that interpolates untrusted text must sandbox that span itself, as the existing ones do. Guided surfaces were unaffected. Closes `F-REVIEW-GUIDANCE-UNWRAPPED-COUNTERPARTY`.
- **CAMT statement references are sandboxed on the default surface.** `bank_reference`, `ref_number` and the skipped-row `sample_refs` passed raw into the standard/full `import_camt053` envelope, and `parse_camt053` wrapped the counterparty and description but not the references. These are remitter-written text of exactly the same class — `AcctSvcrRef` / `EndToEndId` and `RmtInf/Strd/CdtrRefInf/Ref`, only trimmed on the way in — and the compact presenter already wrapped them, so the default profile carried a live unwrapped sink that the guided one did not. The previous rationale was byte-compatibility, which is a compatibility preference, not a safety property. Identity and deduplication run on the raw upstream entry, so matching and re-import behaviour are unchanged. The one write boundary that did *not* strip the markers — `cleanup_camt_possible_duplicate`, which writes caller-supplied `patch_missing_fields` straight to the transaction — now desandboxes like its sibling does; left wrapped, a `ref_number` would have been stored truncated to its 20-character cap as `<<UNTRUSTED_OCR_STAR` and broken later deduplication on that reference.
- **The mutating auto-confirm path decodes invoice status fail-closed.** `decodeInvoiceStatusCritical` was added to the read-only suggest path but not to the filter that selects invoices for `auto_confirm_exact_matches`, which still read `payment_status` / `status` raw. A malformed value is unsafe in the dangerous direction: the number `42` is not equal to `"PAID"`, so an already-settled invoice entered the open set and could be auto-confirmed against a transaction a second time. The guard now covers the mutating path too.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Cross-mechanism bank-posting duplicate guard.** The same real-world cash movement could previously be booked twice through different mechanisms — a manual journal crediting a bank dimension directly, a `create_transaction` row, a reconcile exact-match confirm, and a receipt/PDF intake each only detected duplicates *within* their own mechanism. A new guard (`src/bank-posting-duplicate-guard.ts`) scans all registered journal postings on a bank account's dimension for a same-direction, same-amount, nearby-date posting and surfaces it as a **POSSIBLE duplicate** (a suspect, never a certainty — two legitimate identical payments are possible). It is wired into `create_transaction`, `create_journal` (fast-pathed to bank-dimension postings only), the reconcile exact-match confirm + suggest flows, and the receipt/PDF intake. **Advisory by default** — never auto-deletes or auto-merges; each mutation tool gains an opt-in `block_on_duplicate` that refuses creation *only* when the scan is available AND found a suspect (an unavailable scan never blocks). Match key: account + dimension + amount (±0.01 EUR) + direction + effective date within ±7 days. The guard is fail-safe: a journals-fetch past the 200-page cap or a bank-reference reference-read error degrades to a "Duplicate scan unavailable" note and the booking proceeds — an advisory sub-check never fails a legitimate booking. Suspect journal titles are sandbox-wrapped as untrusted text. No new tools (surface stays 123).
- **CAMT statement closing-balance tripwire.** When an imported CAMT statement carries a CLBD closing balance bound to a bank dimension, `import_camt053` now compares it against the expected balance (opening-balance fold + booked postings up to the balance date + signed unconfirmed PROJECT transactions) with a **0.10 EUR tolerance** and surfaces a `statement_balance_check` with an advisory warning on divergence. Advisory-only and fail-safe (never blocks or throws out of the import); EUR-base comparison only (a non-EUR closing balance is reported but its warning is suppressed as an FX mismatch); on `execute` the per-dimension closing balance is persisted to `statement-balances.json` in the accounting bundle (bundle mode only, skipped with a note under single-file rules mode).
- **Source-reference idempotency.** Bank `ref_number` is canonicalized (trimmed and capped at 20 chars — the maintainer-reported backend limit, a fallback assumption, not demo-probe-confirmed) so an over-cap reference cannot silently mismatch on re-import. CAMT import canonicalizes each entry's reference **at source**, so its duplicate-detection identity (entry signature + exact-duplicate keys) is built from the same capped value the ledger stores and the write boundary is a no-op — a re-imported statement dedupes correctly even for references over the cap. For manually created (`create_transaction`) and Wise rows, when the reference exceeds the cap the full value is additionally woven into `description` — before any trailing source-direction / camt marker so end-anchored metadata regexes still match, and bounded to the description length limit so it never overflows or evicts the marker — so the complete reference is not lost; Wise dedup applies the identical canonicalization + weave, so an over-cap row still matches its previously-stored truncated transaction. `create_journal` now emits an advisory warning when its `document_number` already exists on a live journal (creation still proceeds).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- `compute_account_dimension_balances` — read-only per-dimension balance breakdown for one account (e.g. the LHV/Wise/Lightyear dimensions of account 1020); the total reconciles to `compute_account_balance`. The algbilanss opening-balance import now captures and attributes opening balances per dimension. This raises the default tool surface to 123 (118 with Lightyear disabled). When a multi-dimension account's pasted opening-balance label cannot be resolved to exactly one dimension, the amount is booked to the account without a dimension id and an advisory warning naming the unresolved label is surfaced (the label is sandbox-wrapped as untrusted text).

### Changed

- The server's session-start instructions and the README now carry an advisory about the **v0.22.0 backwards-booking regression window** (roughly Sunday 2026-07-19 22:30 – Monday 2026-07-20 04:15): anyone who ran an e-arveldaja-mcp session while 0.22.0 was current should compare what e-arveldaja reports as the bank-account balance against the real balance and re-import the affected bank statements if they differ.

## [0.22.1] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **Incoming bank transactions were booked backwards — High-severity regression
  introduced in 0.22.0, now fixed.** 0.22.0 forced every newly created bank
  transaction to API `type: "C"` regardless of direction. The e-arveldaja backend
  derives the cash-account leg from that `type` at confirmation, so **incoming**
  rows (owner deposits, customer receipts, refunds, incoming transfers — including
  incoming inter-account transfers) were booked as money *out*: cash credited
  instead of debited, the counter-account reversed, and the cash balance moved by
  2× the amount in the wrong direction. The ledger still balanced
  (debits = credits), so nothing errored — only the direction was wrong.
  `createBankTransaction` (`src/bank-transaction-create.ts`) now sets `type` from
  the true statement direction (incoming → `"D"`, outgoing → `"C"`), taken from the
  explicit direction the CAMT/Wise importers pass or derived from the payload's
  signed `source_direction` marker. The CAMT/Wise projections and
  `create_transaction` (whose `type` argument is honored again) now show the real
  directional type, so a review card can no longer display `type: "C"` next to
  `source_direction: "IN"`. Read-side classification continues to prefer signed
  `source_direction` metadata. Live-ledger evidence confirmed the backend uses
  `type` to place the cash leg on the inter-account path too, so the directional
  mapping is required there as well. **Anyone who ran 0.22.0 must re-book the
  reversed journals it created** (incoming rows with a "Tasumine" journal / cash on
  the credit side).

## [0.22.0] - 2026-07-19

> **Significant behaviour-changing release — the default/recommended account numbers were rewritten.** The hardcoded chart-of-accounts defaults were originally written for a non-standard template and were wrong for the real e-arveldaja RTJ standard chart (verified byte-identical across two real company charts). Every default was audited and corrected, and — more importantly — the tools now resolve each account **by its Estonian name** against the company's *actual* chart, using the standard number only as a last-resort fallback. If you previously relied on a specific default account number, re-check your postings: several defaults now point at different accounts (see below). This also corrects the default accounts used when booking Lightyear investment activity.

This release also lands a full code-review remediation pass (49 findings across the H- and M-series, plus dependency/release findings D01–D02). Each finding was reproduced with a red-green regression, independently reviewed, and committed atomically. Entries below lead with the finding ID for traceability.

### Safe prompt pipeline (P01–P25)

A 25-task remediation reworked how the 16 workflow prompts are defined,
argued, rendered, and guarded. Each task shipped with a red-green regression
and an independent review.

- **Strict string prompt arguments (P01).** Every MCP workflow-prompt argument
  is now a **string** parsed into a typed value by `src/prompt-arguments.ts`,
  never a numeric or boolean MCP argument. A client always passes wire strings;
  an invalid boolean/number/ID/date/month/path/identifier/JSON string returns a
  safe, bounded `-32602` error instead of being coerced.
- **Canonical prompt pipeline (P02/P03/P04).** Prompt text no longer lives in
  `src/prompts.ts`. A canonical registry (`src/prompt-registry.ts`) → workflow
  Markdown sources (`workflows/*.md` via `src/workflow-prompt-source.ts`) →
  one shared renderer (`src/prompt-surface.ts`) → MCP prompts and the generated
  `.claude/commands/*.md` slash commands. The renderer injects a single shared
  safety wrapper, sandboxes external text in a fresh per-call
  `E_ARVELDAJA_RUN_DATA` boundary, and enforces a 64,000-character budget;
  `npm run validate:release` enforces set-equality across registry, workflow
  sources, command mirrors, and the README workflow table.
- **Sales-aware variants (P05).** `E_ARVELDAJA_FEATURE_*` sections in the
  workflow sources are kept or dropped per deployment, so a sales-disabled
  server renders purchase-only prompts without receivables/sale-invoice steps.
- **Dated VAT/tax metadata (P06).** VAT threshold, rates, and effective/verified
  dates render from one canonical versioned metadata object in
  `src/estonian-tax-rules.ts`, so every prompt and command shows the same dated
  facts rather than a hardcoded rate.
- **One-attempt server plan handles with drift gates (P03/P04/P05/P12/P15/P18/P19).**
  The mutating import/reconciliation workflows (CAMT, bank reconciliation,
  Lightyear, Wise, credential setup) issue a single-use, scope-bound server
  plan handle on preview. **A plan handle is not user approval** — the handle is
  consumed once (burn-before-validate ⇒ replay rejected), re-reads its immutable
  source, and re-checks digest/args/scope/fingerprint before the first mutation;
  any drift rejects the plan with zero writes. Explicit user approval is
  recorded separately from the handle.
- **Opaque file references and immutable snapshots (P09).** File inputs are
  exchanged as opaque `file_ref` handles bound to the runtime safety context
  instead of raw filesystem paths, and receipt approval is bound to a once-read
  SHA-256 digest/manifest so a file swap fails closed before any mutation.
- **Bank transaction type-C invariant (P10).** Every production bank-transaction
  create crosses one shared boundary that stamps API `type: "C"`; direction is
  derived from signed source metadata downstream.
- **Legal-entity identity gate (P17).** Supplier/client auto-creation requires a
  verified Estonian registry code, natural-person, or operator-attested foreign
  identity before any create, and never trusts a document-inferred value.
- **Invoice supplier branch and validation evidence (P08/P09/P10).** The
  book-invoice workflow branches existing vs new suppliers and carries
  truncation/OCR/provenance/warning evidence onto the approval card.
- **Output/workflow alignment and external-text sandboxing (P07/P11/P13).**
  Staged receipts keep **create/upload** and **confirm**/link as separate
  approvals; display fields from supplier/registry/Lightyear/Inbox surfaces are
  wrapped in a fresh outer sandbox with a `>20k` sentinel, while matching,
  audit, `document_number`, and API paths use separate clean copies.
- **Workflow-trace invariant harness (P22).** A pure trace model and checker
  prove, for every mutating workflow, that no mutation precedes its covering
  user approval, no unavailable tool is called, mutation stays in approved
  scope, and any scope change forces a fresh preview.
- **Documentation and doc contract (P25).** README, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` now describe the shipped pipeline, and
  `src/documentation-contract.test.ts` pins these claims so a doc regression
  fails.

### Opening balances (algbilanss)

- **New tool — `import_opening_balances`.** e-arveldaja's REST API omits the
  "Algbilansi kanded" (opening-balance entries) section, so the server was
  previously blind to opening balances. This tool lets the operator paste
  that register once: it parses the text, validates that total debit equals
  total credit, previews the parsed per-account balances (`dry_run=true`
  default), and on `dry_run=false` persists them as `opening-balances.json`
  in the same accounting-rules bundle used for booking rules.
- **Folded into six computations.** At compute time the stored opening
  balances are injected as one synthetic journal dated at the opening date
  (`src/opening-balance-journal.ts`), so `compute_account_balance`,
  `compute_trial_balance`, `compute_balance_sheet`, `compute_profit_and_loss`,
  `generate_annual_report_data`, and the ÄS §157 dividend legality checks in
  `prepare_dividend_package` all fold it in automatically — no per-consumer
  wiring needed.
- **Optional by default.** With nothing imported, every consumer behaves
  exactly as before; the previous blind "verify opening balances in the UI"
  warning is now an actionable one pointing directly at
  `import_opening_balances` (also surfaced in `list_journals`/`get_journal`).

### Added
- **D02 — packed-release smoke on Node 18.** A new publish-payload smoke builds the project, `npm pack`s it, validates the packed file list against the source-of-truth workflow-slug set, installs the tarball into a throwaway tree, and runs the installed **bin shim itself** (not `node <file>`) under a hermetic environment — inherited `EARVELDAJA_*` stripped case-insensitively, config discovery pointed at an empty dir, torn down via stdin EOF so the stdio server shuts down cleanly. Wired into a Node 18 CI job and `prepublishOnly`, so a broken packaged entrypoint or a missing shipped file is caught before publish.
- **M24 — workflow dimension prompt arguments now accepted.** Several workflow prompts documented optional bank-account dimension override arguments that the prompt `argsSchema` did not actually accept, so a client passing them had the call rejected by MCP schema validation. The missing optional args are now exposed: `accounting-inbox` (`bank_account_dimension_id`, `receipt_matching_dimension_id`, `wise_account_dimension_id`), `import-wise` (`inter_account_dimension_id`), and `reconcile-bank` (`target_accounts_dimensions_id`). `book-invoice`'s per-item dimension fields are intentionally still not exposed as scalar prompt args.

### Changed
- **Chart-of-accounts defaults corrected to the RTJ standard chart, with name-based resolution (`src/account-resolution.ts`, new).** Every tool that books to an equity/liability/financial account now resolves the account by its Estonian `name_est` against the company's real chart (anchored regexes), falling back to the standard number only when no active name match exists — robust across custom or older charts where a hardcoded number can be wrong. The corrected standard-number fallbacks (`src/accounting-defaults.ts`):
  - **Retained earnings** (Eelmiste perioodide jaotamata kasum) `3020 → 2960`.
  - **Dividend payable** (Dividendivõlad) `2370 → 2650`.
  - **Dividend income-tax payable** (Dividenditulumaksu võlg) `2540 → 2656`. The old **2540 is "Kogumispensioni maksed"** (mandatory-pension payments) — the 22/78 dividend CIT liability was being booked against the wrong liability account.
  - **Share capital** (Osakapital) `3000 → 2900`. The old **3000 is "Põhivara müügi vahekonto"** (fixed-asset-sale clearing) — so the ÄS § 157(2) net-assets legality check was reading share capital off the wrong balance.
  - **Reserve capital** (Kohustuslik reservkapital) `3010 → 2940`.
  - **FX gain/loss** now a **single combined account 8500** (Kasum/kahjum valuutakursi muutustest) for both directions. The old loss default **8600 is "Muud finantstulud"** (a financial *income* account), so an FX loss was posting to income with the wrong sign.
  - **Other financial income** `3800 → 8600`. The old **3800 ("Muud äritulud") did not exist in the standard chart**.
- **Lightyear investment booking routes to the corrected securities accounts** (per the owner's booking policy): realized **gain → 8330**, realized **loss and expensed trade/FX fees → 8335**, **dividends → 8330**, platform **rewards/bonuses → 8600** (other financial income, not securities income), **withholding → 8610**. A Buy trade's platform fee stays capitalised into FIFO cost basis; only the Buy FX conversion fee is expensed. The shared prompt fee argument was split into `trade_fee_account` (8335) and `distribution_fee_account` (8610) so trade and distribution fees can no longer cross-contaminate.
- **ÄS § 157(2) restricted-reserve floor now sums *every* "Kohustuslik reservkapital" account (active or inactive) unioned with the standard 2940.** A funded-but-renamed or deactivated reserve is never missed, so the statutory net-assets floor can never be silently understated. The floor keys on the booked balance (unfunded accounts add nothing); a transparency warning and põhikiri guidance are surfaced, and `restricted_reserve_accounts` still overrides.

### Fixed

**Idempotency, duplicate booking, and ambiguous-mutation recovery**
- **H03 — transaction confirmation preserves the buyer/supplier on an ambiguous register.** When the register / re-read / cleanup outcome is network-ambiguous, `TransactionsApi.confirm` now keeps `clients_id` and the transaction id, invalidates every affected cache, and returns neutral recovery data instead of firing a speculative compensating mutation that could corrupt an already-committed journal.
- **H04 — confirmed journals and invoices are immutable through generic update tools.** A confirmed record now accepts only explicitly approved descriptive metadata; any ledger-bearing or lifecycle field edit fails atomically with `category: "confirmed_record_immutable"` plus invalidate-fetch-edit-reconfirm guidance. Draft/PROJECT ledger edits remain compatible.
- **H05 — `confirm_purchase_invoice` no longer silently recalculates approved totals.** Ordinary confirmation preserves the invoice's totals; recomputation is now an explicit two-call opt-in — the read-only `preview_purchase_invoice_totals_correction` returns a no-mutation snapshot that must be passed back as `approved_correction` alongside `recalculate_totals: true` — so a silent total rewrite can no longer alter a booked amount. The internal `preserveExistingTotals` alias was removed in favour of the safe default.
- **H06 — create-once journal booking is serialized across processes.** A cross-process file lock keyed on a connection fingerprint now guards the create-once path, so two concurrent server processes can no longer both create the same journal.
- **H07 — currency-rounding settlement uses the invoice liability account and allocated amount.** `reconcile_currency_rounding` now books against the invoice header's liability account (its source of truth) and the allocated payment amount rather than a nominal figure; a malformed, zero, negative, or non-finite account/dimension forces review instead of posting.
- **M01 — indeterminate mutations invalidate caches and record audit metadata.** The generic resource layer now busts every affected cache and writes structured audit metadata when a create/update/delete outcome is network-ambiguous, so a possibly-committed write is never masked by stale cache state.

**Bank import (CAMT / Wise)**
- **H08 — CAMT statement IBAN is bound to the selected bank dimension.** Import now asserts the statement's IBAN matches the chosen bank-account dimension before booking, so a statement cannot be imported against the wrong bank account.
- **H09 — CAMT duplicate detection is scoped by bank dimension.** The bank-reference lookup key now includes the account dimension, so the same reference number appearing on two different bank accounts is no longer treated as a duplicate.
- **H10 — one-sided FX transfers post the authoritative EUR amount.** Matching, preview, distribution, journal indexing, and audit for one-sided cross-currency transfers now use the transaction's EUR `base_amount` (via `authoritativeTransferEurAmount`) instead of the foreign nominal amount.
- **H19 — CAMT possible-duplicate deletion proves identity first.** `cleanup_camt_possible_duplicate` previously deleted a PROJECT row on status alone; it now requires the coarse candidate key (bank dimension, date, direction, currency, rounded amount — each failing closed when absent), a structured corroborator (reference / counterparty IBAN / name, deliberately excluding the free-text description), and no bank-reference divergence, all reusing the system's own possible-duplicate proposal logic. A mismatch throws; the residual same-merchant/same-day/same-amount case stays behind human approval.
- **M03 — Wise inter-account transfers verify endpoint ownership.** A `TRANSFER-*` marker is now only a hint; `classifyWiseOwnTransfer` confirms the counterparty is one of the company's own bank accounts before treating a row as an own-transfer.
- **M04 — Wise dry-run and execution are kept in parity.** Preview and execution now run through one shared executor over a `WiseImportCommand[]`, and execution requires the dry-run's `approved_command_digest`, so what was previewed is exactly what is booked.
- **M05 — CAMT and Wise rows are validated strictly before any import.** Malformed fields are collected as `rejected_fields` and fail preflight (before any cache clear, API read, audit entry, or mutation) instead of being truncated, defaulted, or silently skipped; `parseTagValue: false` stops fast-xml-parser from coercing values like `<Amt>0x10</Amt>` to `16`. Blank/lowercase/padded values that real exports legitimately carry stay accepted.

**Receipt inbox and supplier resolution**
- **H13 — a strong supplier identifier vetoes a name match.** `resolveSupplierInternal` no longer resolves a supplier by name when the invoice's registry code or VAT number contradicts the name-matched client's own identifier; a genuine conflict routes to `requires_manual_review` (own-company identifiers are excluded so a mis-scanned buyer code cannot veto a real supplier).
- **H14 — receipt booking preserves post-create recovery state.** A create that fails ambiguously is now classified `mutation_indeterminate` (vs `mutation_failed`), and every entity status is evidence-based (`UNKNOWN` unless proven), so a partially-completed receipt booking surfaces actionable recovery data instead of a misleading blanket failure.
- **H15 — document approval is bound to the source SHA-256 bytes.** The receipt-batch and single-PDF flows now snapshot the file bytes once and bind approval to a SHA-256 manifest/digest, rejecting any file swap/addition/deletion before any API mutation (closing a TOCTOU); an aggregate batch over 256 MB is refused up front.
- **M06 — receipt identifier and date extraction are hardened.** IBAN extraction now scans all candidates and returns the first mod-97-valid one (instead of stopping at a malformed leading match), and date normalization round-trips its ISO branch so impossible calendar dates (e.g. `2026-02-30`) are rejected rather than reaching a booking field.
- **M07 — payment-receipt invoice matching requires supplier identity.** A receipt's OCR invoice number is matched to a purchase invoice only within the same supplier (resolved client id, else normalized name); a non-unique or ambiguous match routes to review with `ambiguity_reason=supplier_identity_required`.
- **M08 — receipt file-date and bank accounting-date filters are separated.** The receipt file modified-date window no longer restricts which bank transactions are eligible for auto-matching; new `transaction_date_from` / `transaction_date_to` scope the bank side independently.
- **M09 — receipt batch fails closed when own-company identity cannot load.** A present-but-throwing `invoice_info` endpoint now returns `protection_state=retryable_error` before the manifest gate and any mutation, instead of continuing with a weakened self-match guard; a permanently-absent endpoint stays best-effort (VAT-based self-match still applies).
- **M10 — persisted receipt-classification text is canonicalized.** `apply_transaction_classifications` now strips sandbox wrapper delimiters (`canonicalBusinessText`) before the value drives rule matching, booking, and the audit summary, while response notes still echo the wrapped value so output stays sandboxed.
- **M11 — inbox review pages are complete and resumable.** The `.slice(0, 5)` truncations that silently dropped review items were removed, and each item now carries a stable `stableReviewId` (sha256 over stable business keys, nonce-independent so a re-run yields the same id) plus a `review_page { total, complete }` flag.
- **M12 — reconciliation is deferred until imports materialize.** Every ledger-reading step (classification and `reconcile_inter_account_transfers`) is now gated on pending import materialization and marked `deferred` with a `materialization_state` (`current | pending_imports | failed`), so reconciliation never runs against a stale pre-import ledger.
- **M13 — every discovered receipt folder is processed.** The inbox pipeline now emits one deterministic (path-sorted) `process_receipt_batch` step per eligible folder instead of only the first, so multi-folder inboxes are fully processed.
- **M14 — unknown review types return actionable errors.** A foreign `review_type` now returns an `unsupported_review_type` contract with a non-empty question and the supported-types list, and a supported type arriving without its payload returns a distinct actionable `needs_answers`; no caller-supplied value is echoed into the response.

**Lightyear investments**
- **H16 — Lightyear FX orientation is explicit.** A foreign-currency trade fee is unbookable until a fully reconciled conversion pair proves both a rate and its orientation; the raw foreign fee is never returned or booked as though it were already EUR.
- **H17 — distribution currency and EUR values are preserved.** Each extracted distribution keeps its normalized currency and its original nominal gross/net/tax/fee; a separate read-only reservation pre-pass stops a distribution from reusing or laundering trade FX evidence, and a foreign nominal is never labelled or posted as EUR.
- **H18 — capital-gains proceeds matching is tolerant but bounded.** Sell-to-capital-gains candidate classification uses a finite, deterministic tolerance predicate; it never consumes an out-of-tolerance row, never uses row order as a tie-breaker, and never turns a non-finite value into a match.
- **M25 — Lightyear statement argument renamed to `file_path`.** The `lightyear-booking` prompt and `recommend_workflow` named the statement input `statement_path` while `parse_lightyear_statement` takes `file_path`, so an agent following the prompt passed a rejected argument. The input is now `file_path` on every surface, with `capital_gains_path` kept distinct and both parse-step mappings spelled out in the runbook.
- **M26 — portfolio outcomes are separated into exclusive buckets.** `book_lightyear_trades` and `lightyear_portfolio_summary` now return exclusive `booked_basis`, `previewed`, `skipped`, and `review_required` arrays, and WAC holdings plus every legacy total derive only from `booked_basis`, so a skipped or review-required row can no longer contaminate the booked position.

**Tax and statutory reporting**
- **H11 — an explicit zero-VAT line is preserved.** A stated "VAT 0.00" is now retained (opt-in, only where the line's own subject is the VAT) so zero-rated, exempt, and reverse-charge receipts book instead of going to `needs_review`; guards keep the retained zero from destroying a real VAT (a later non-zero explicit VAT line supersedes it, and a zero contradicted by an explicit net and gross is discarded for the reconciled gross − net).
- **M19 — incomplete opening balances are surfaced.** Account-balance and annual-report outputs now carry `opening_balance_status`, `balance_scope`, and a warning when the `/journals` API omits opening-balance ("Algbilansi kanded") entries, so a check never silently runs on partial data.
- **M20 — year-end-close detection is unified.** A single canonical `isYearEndClosingJournal` helper is now shared by close discovery and period-P&L filtering, replacing divergent detectors.
- **M21 — non-VAT companies never get deductible-VAT defaults.** Purchase-item defaults for a non-VAT-registered company (validated by `validateNonVatItem`) never carry `vat_accounts_id`, `vat_accounts_dimensions_id`, or a deductible VAT article/rate.

**Infrastructure, storage, and credential hardening**
- **H01 — project-root resolution works on Node 18.** `getProjectRoot` now derives the module path in a Node 18-compatible way (no `import.meta.dirname`), keeping the supported `>=18.0.0` engine range; a dependency-free CLI smoke and a CI job pin it.
- **H02 — TOON output is emitted only when losslessly round-trippable.** `toMcpJson` now emits TOON only when its decoded output is deeply equal to the source (`jsonDeepEqual`), falling back to JSON otherwise, so a value TOON would silently garble is never sent.
- **M02 — malformed pagination fails closed.** A new `validatePage` rejects a non-object / non-array-`items` response, a non-positive requested page, or a `current_page` / `total_pages` that does not match the request, with a typed error (never message-text classification).
- **M15 — workspace traversal is budget-bounded.** The scan now counts every inspected directory entry (not just matching files) against `MAX_SCANNED_FILES` and streams directories with `opendir`, surfacing `inspected_entries` / `entry_limit` / `truncated` / continuation guidance, so a directory full of non-matching files cannot make traversal cost unbounded.
- **M16 — audit summaries render exactly once.** `AuditEntry.summary` was captured but never rendered by the human-readable log; it now renders once per entry (empty summaries skipped, double-render guarded), and a lone `CR` is normalized to a space to close a markdown line-break injection path on this newly-surfaced field.
- **M17 — audit relabel/merge is serialized against concurrent append.** Every audit-file mutation (append and relabel/merge) now runs under one cross-process lock (`withOwnedFileLockSync`), so a relabel's read-modify-write can no longer orphan or recreate a file that a concurrent append races.
- **M18 — every audit read enforces the default limit.** The raw-content fast path was removed, so an unfiltered read now caps to the newest `limit` (default 100); the entry delimiter was made unforgeable (field line-breaks normalized, fragments re-grouped into logical entries) so an embedded separator — even in a historical log — cannot inflate the count and hide earlier records.
- **M22 — accounting-rule migration collisions are detected.** `findRuleMigrationConflicts` now aborts a rule migration before any staged write when two rules would map to the same canonical concept key.
- **M23 — connection-scoped generated rules are isolated.** Generated per-connection accounting-rule stores are now isolated per connection and git-ignored (`accounting-rules/`), so one company's generated rules cannot leak into another connection's.
- **M27 — `.env` credential metadata lines are validated.** Per-connection metadata comment lines (`# Company` / `# Verified at` / `# Imported from`) now reject any control character (CR/LF/NUL/TAB, DEL/C1, U+2028/U+2029) via `serializeEnvComment`, so a crafted company name can no longer break out of its comment line and inject a forged `.env` entry such as `EARVELDAJA_API_PASSWORD=`; an anomalous value aborts the write.
- **M28 — hardening `.env` permissions no longer clobbers its contents.** `ensurePrivateEnvFile` now runs before the credential read-modify-write: it rejects a symlink/non-regular target, chmods 0600 when group/other bits are set, and fails closed (leaving existing bytes intact) when privacy cannot be established — replacing the old path that merged an empty parse of an insecure `.env` and silently discarded the file's existing credentials.
- **M29 — insecure stderr logging fails closed.** `installStderrTee` now re-reads the fd mode after chmod and, on any failure to prove the log file is 0600, closes the descriptor and returns `{ enabled: false }` instead of streaming secret-bearing stderr into a file that cannot be proven private.
- **D01 — stored external text is sandboxed at the CRUD read/write boundaries.** Import-origin free-text fields (OCR/auto-booked supplier and client names, journal titles, CAMT descriptions/counterparties, invoice line `custom_title`) are now re-wrapped with a fresh nonce on CRUD read and stripped on write, closing the stored (second-order) prompt-injection vector the "trust is gated at import" decision left open; operator-configured reference data stays raw.
- **Sandbox (untrusted-OCR) markers are now stripped at every write/persist boundary, closing a second-order prompt-injection path (owner follow-on to D01).** External text (PDF/OCR, CAMT, broker CSV, upstream errors) is wrapped in a per-call nonce sandbox on read; a wrapped value could previously round-trip through the LLM back into a create/update/save with the `<<UNTRUSTED_OCR_…>>` framing intact. A new field-agnostic `desandboxAllStrings` helper (recurses objects/arrays, prototype-pollution-guarded) now cleans every string at each write boundary — the generic CRUD create/update handlers, `saveAutoBookingRule` and the save-rule/prepare paths, the CAMT duplicate-cleanup ledger patch, supplier resolution, the PDF booking flow, owner-expense reimbursement, and the reference-data mutation tools. Identity fields (`file_path`, `source_sha256`) are read verbatim and never canonicalised. JSON-string item payloads are parsed *before* cleaning so wrapper framing can't survive inside nested line-item titles.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- **`prepare_dividend_package` retained-earnings ceiling is now NET-based (ÄS § 157 lg 1).** The check previously required retained earnings to cover the GROSS distribution (net + CIT), which wrongly blocked distributing the full retained-earnings balance as net dividend — under the prevailing reading of ÄS § 157 lg 1 the statutory ceiling applies to the distribution decided by the shareholders (the net dividend), while the 22/78 income tax is the company's own current-period expense (TuMS § 50), not part of the payout. The § 157 lg 2 net-assets floor stays gross-based, because the payout does create both a dividend payable and a tax liability. Regression tests cover the exact previously-blocked scenario (net dividend == full retained earnings, gross above it).

### Added
- **`maximum_distributable.max_net_dividend` on every `prepare_dividend_package` path** (blocked, dry-run, executed): the largest lawful net dividend on the current ledger, min(retained earnings [lg 1], (net assets − § 157 lg 2 floor) × 78/100), floored to whole cents so booking exactly the reported maximum always passes both checks, with `limited_by` naming the binding clause.
- **`compliance_notes` on `prepare_dividend_package`**: ÄS § 157 lg 1 requires an approved annual report and a profit-distribution decision (attach the decision to the journal via `attach_document`), and the CIT is declared on TSD annex 7 by the 10th of the month following the payout (TuMS § 54).
- **`earveldaja://tax_rules` now covers profit distribution and RPS process rules.** New `profit_distribution_rules` (ÄS § 157 lg 1 net-based ceiling incl. the "entire retained earnings distributable as net dividend" statement, ÄS § 157 lg 2 net-assets floor, TuMS § 50 rate/booking/declaration) and `accounting_process_rules` (RPS § 10 traceable corrections, RPS § 12 seven-year retention, RPS § 15 inventory duty + ÄS § 179 six-month filing deadline) catalogues, a TuMS § 48 fringe-benefit reference entry, the CIT rate timeline, the VAT registration threshold, and a `verified_at` freshness stamp (`TAX_RULES_VERIFIED_AT`).
- **`prepare_year_end_close` returns `statutory_reminders`** — RPS § 15 inventory of asset/liability balances, ÄS § 179 six-month annual-report filing deadline, RPS § 12 seven-year source-document retention.
- **RPS § 10 correction-traceability note on the four `invalidate_*` tool descriptions** (journal, transaction, purchase invoice, sale invoice).

### Changed
- **All date-gated statutory figures now live in `src/estonian-tax-rules.ts`.** The dividend CIT rate moved there as a `CIT_RATE_TIMELINE` (matching the VAT-rate timeline pattern; `getCitRateForDate` is re-exported from `src/tools/estonian-tax.ts` for existing importers), and `VAT_REGISTRATION_THRESHOLD_EUR` moved alongside it. The Estonian-tax tool descriptions (`prepare_dividend_package`, `check_tax_free_limits`, `check_vat_registration_threshold`) render their rates/limits from these constants instead of hardcoded strings, with tests pinning the rendered values, so a future law change is a one-module edit.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **Full-codebase security & correctness review (7-pass Codex review, verified).** Every finding was checked against the actual code before acting; roughly eighteen were dropped as false positives and none survived as high-severity. The confirmed defects are fixed, each with regression tests:
  - **Network-error messages no longer leak the auth public value / HMAC signature.** `formatNetworkError` now emits only the error name and code (never the raw fetch message, which for some failures echoes the offending header value). The HTTP client also refuses unexpected 3xx redirects (`redirect: "manual"`) and classifies a failed/timed-out response-body read as a network error.
  - **`TransactionsApi.confirm` no longer rolls back a possibly-committed registration when the post-network-error re-read itself fails.** It now throws an explicit indeterminate-state error instead of blindly reverting `clients_id`.
  - **Aging analysis** signs credit-invoice gross, separates the `as_of_date` cutoff from the actual current date, excludes future-dated invoices, and warns on missing `term_days`.
  - **Account-balance and financial-statement totals are computed from raw sums and rounded once**, eliminating ±0.01 debit/credit rounding drift, including `compute_client_debt`.
  - **`reconcile_currency_rounding`** routes unconvertible-foreign / EUR-residual / rate-load failures to the review bucket and dates FX journals to the settlement date.
  - **Cross-currency inter-account transfers whose confirmed leg is foreign now route to a `cross_currency_review` bucket** instead of auto-distributing the foreign nominal amount to the target account (which booked the wrong figure). EUR-leg FX pairs (`nominal == base`) still auto-confirm. A coincidental cross-currency nominal match against an invoice is likewise flagged for review instead of scoring `exact_amount`. `min_confidence` is bounded to 0–100.
  - **Untrusted-text sandbox holes closed.** A CAMT duplicate-cleanup patch that round-tripped through the LLM as sandbox-wrapped review text is now unwrapped (`unwrapUntrustedOcr`) before write-back, so the `<<UNTRUSTED_OCR_START…>>` delimiters can never be persisted into a ledger field. Failed import/parse-step error messages are capped and wrapped before reaching MCP output. `created_invoice.number`, `normalized_counterparty`, and other OCR-derived output strings are now wrapped and length-capped.
  - **`parseMcpResponse` parses JSON-shaped input as JSON first** — TOON's `decode()` silently garbles a JSON string without throwing, which corrupted merged-tool reporting on the JSON-fallback path.
  - **CAMT parsing** strips XML namespace prefixes (`removeNSPrefix`) so a namespace-qualified `<ns:Document>` statement parses instead of failing with "found 0 <Stmt>".
  - **Receipt/invoice extraction** honours accounting-style parenthesised negatives (`(124.00)` → −124); the labelled Estonian registry-code regex gained a digit boundary so a 9-digit number no longer matches an 8-digit prefix.
  - **Lightyear import** deduplicates repeated references within one CSV and branches on the `createJournalOnce` duplicate outcome, so a guarded duplicate is no longer double-counted in the audit log or report.
  - **Setup-mode credential verification** keys its cache by a hash of the full credential identity (not just the key id), so re-importing the same key id with a corrected password re-verifies instead of reusing the stale result; setup instructions no longer advertise the Lightyear parsers when that group is disabled.
  - **Receipt-inbox orchestration** propagates a non-404 transaction-lookup error as a real failure (instead of silently skipping a valid transaction), reserves dry-run bank-match candidates so two receipts cannot both preview the same transaction, and warns that create mode re-scans the folder at execution time.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- **`TransactionsApi.confirm` now recovers from an ambiguous network failure on the register call.** Confirming a transaction issues `PATCH /transactions/{id}/register`, which creates a journal server-side, so a dropped connection or timeout is ambiguous — the registration may have committed. Previously such a failure ran the `clients_id` rollback (which would corrupt a *committed* journal's buyer/supplier) and threw, signalling a false failure that could prompt a duplicating retry. On a network error the method now re-reads the transaction (busting the stale cache) and checks its status: if `CONFIRMED` the registration landed, so it keeps `clients_id`, flushes the journal cache, and reports success (with no `created_object_id` — callers already record the sentinel journal id); if still `PROJECT` it rolls back and rethrows as before. A non-network HTTP status is propagated unchanged.
- **`BookingGuard.createJournalOnce` now recovers from ambiguous network failures (verify-then-retry).** A journal-create POST that fails with a *network* error (timeout / dropped connection, `HttpError.status === "network"`) is ambiguous — the RIK API signs only the request path, not the body, so it has no server-side idempotency and the write may or may not have committed. Rather than blindly retrying (risking a duplicate) or blindly failing (risking an orphan plus a user retry that duplicates), the guard busts the stale journals cache and re-scans the ledger by the create's `document_number` key: if the journal is found the ambiguous write committed, so it is recovered (`recovered: true`) and confirmed if it landed in `PROJECT`, with no retry; if it is not found the create is retried exactly once. A non-network HTTP status (4xx/5xx) is propagated unchanged, since the server saw and rejected the request. The generic http-client keeps its no-retry gate for non-idempotent methods — recovery lives at the guard level, the only place with a checkable key. `reconcile_currency_rounding` and the Lightyear booking sites inherit this automatically.

### Changed
- **Journal idempotency is now centralized in a single `BookingGuard` layer (`src/booking-guard.ts`).** The RIK API signs only the request path, not the body, so it offers no server-side idempotency — every booking tool had to hand-roll its own "did I already book this?" scan of the ledger, and subtle divergences between those copies (deleted-journal handling, in-run vs cross-run dedup, sentinel journal ids) were the dominant duplicate-booking bug class. `BookingGuard` loads one journal snapshot per run and exposes two lanes: Lane A for namespaced `document_number` keys (`FX:{id}`, `LY:{ref}`) with `find`/`record`/`createJournalOnce`, and Lane B for structural inter-account transfers (`sourceDim|targetDim|amount|date` with reference disambiguation and an optional nearest-first date window). Migrated `reconcile_currency_rounding` (Lane A), the Lightyear buy/sell/cash-equivalent/distribution booking sites (Lane A, preserving the legacy bare-reference date-cross-check), and the Wise and bank-reconciliation inter-account paths (Lane B). Behavior is preserved, with two incidental hardening improvements: `reconcile_currency_rounding` now treats a concurrently-created `FX:` journal as already-reconciled instead of double-posting, and Lightyear booking now dedups repeated references within a single CSV. Lane-A-only callers use the cheaper `listAll` (no per-journal posting fetches); Lane B loads postings only when bank dimensions are supplied.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **Duplicate-booking and balance-drift hardening (whole-codebase review).** Seven high-severity correctness fixes, each with regression tests:
  - **Non-idempotent HTTP requests are no longer retried after a network error or timeout.** A `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` that times out or drops its connection is ambiguous — the server may already have committed the mutation — so retrying risked a duplicate invoice, journal, or transaction. Only `GET` and `PUT` (full replace) retry now; the 5xx retry path was already `GET`-only.
  - **`update_purchase_invoice` re-sends the existing line items when the caller updates header fields only.** The API rejects an item-less PATCH with "Products/services are missing", so every metadata-only update (notes, dates, bank refs) previously failed; the handler now backfills `items` from the current invoice, while a caller that supplies items to change the lines keeps theirs.
  - **The single-PDF flow now applies the same self-supplier defenses as the receipt batch.** `extract_pdf_invoice` resolves the active company's own VAT number and registry code and excludes them from the extracted supplier fields, and `resolve_supplier` threads them into resolution so the previously-dormant self-match guards fire — refusing to resolve or auto-create the buyer's own company as a supplier, which would otherwise book a purchase against self.
  - **`reconcile_currency_rounding` FX-difference journals are now idempotent.** The paid-vs-booked residual does not clear when the `FX:{invoice_id}` journal is posted, so a second `execute` run re-detected the same difference and double-booked it; the tool now skips any invoice that already carries an `FX:` journal.
  - **Inter-account reconciliation no longer confirms both legs of one transfer in a single run.** The in-run journal index was built once at the start and never refreshed, so confirming one leg left the opposite leg looking un-journalized and it was confirmed into a duplicate; each newly-created journal is now recorded into the index immediately.
  - **Receipt auto-link skips cross-currency (base-amount-only) transaction matches.** When a match survived only on base-currency evidence, the transaction amount is in a different currency than the invoice gross, so auto-confirming posted the wrong distribution amount; the guard the sibling bank-reconciliation path already applied now covers the receipt path too, routing such matches to manual review.
  - **Lightyear buy trades capitalize the trade platform fee into investment cost.** The fee was expensed instead of added to cost basis, contradicting the FIFO capital-gains report (which bakes the trade fee into cost basis) and stranding a residual on the investment account after every full sell; only the FX conversion fee — which the report excludes — is expensed.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- **`check_vat_registration_threshold` tool and `vat-registration-threshold` workflow.** Adds a read-only advisory check for the 2025+ Estonian VAT registration threshold: confirmed sale invoices provide the year-to-date taxable/0% net turnover base, while the caller can enter real-estate, insurance, and financial-services turnover separately so the operator can decide whether those amounts are non-incidental and therefore count toward the 40 000 EUR threshold. `manual_bucket_source` tells the tool whether those manual buckets are outside sale invoices or already included there, avoiding double counting when the amounts are reclassified from invoice turnover. The response also shows social-type exempt turnover and already-judged incidental turnover as not counted, returns `exceeded` only when ordinary taxable/0% turnover alone crosses the threshold, and uses `needs_manual_review` when the result depends on the finance/insurance/real-estate classification. The default surface is now 121 tools and 16 workflow prompts; `EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_TAX_TOOLS=1` drops this tool and prompt with the other Estonian tax helpers.
- **Coordinate/layout-aware invoice & receipt extraction.** When a PDF/OCR document exposes text-item coordinates, extraction now understands the document's visual layout instead of only its flattened text. Amounts are read by grouping text items into visual rows and columns and binding net/VAT/gross/subtotal labels to the numeric cell in the same row or column (with provenance `source=coordinate`), falling back to flattened-text scoring when no confident layout result is found. Supplier and buyer **identifiers** (Estonian KMKR VAT number and registrikood) are recovered with a two-tier extractor — labeled matches with EE checksum enforcement (mod-11 registry, mod-10 VAT), then a bare structural tier with top-of-document preference and buyer-line rejection — and disambiguated in two-column layouts by classifying each occurrence's position relative to supplier/buyer markers. The **supplier name** is likewise extracted from the supplier region by font size and position. Every extracted field carries provenance (`bbox` + `source`), and all OCR-derived values are wrapped in the per-call untrusted-OCR nonce sandbox.
- **OCR-quality routing and confidence gating.** An `isComplex()` preflight lets digital PDFs skip OCR (lower latency) while scans force it and mixed documents parse per-page; partial OCR failure is detected by comparing parsed vs native text length rather than a bare character threshold. New **`low_ocr_confidence`** (10th-percentile confidence) and **`partial_ocr_failure`** medium signals route affected receipts to manual review and suppress batch auto-approval, so a poorly-scanned document is never silently auto-booked. LiteParse 2.5 parser controls (OCR failure fatality, hedge delays, image mode, DPI, target pages, etc.) are exposed via env vars.

### Changed
- **Invoicing subsystem refactored for maintainability (no behavior change).** The 330-line `extractIdentifiers` was split into `resolveRegCode` / `resolveVatNo` / `reclassifyByCoordinates`; the 490-line receipt-batch handler was decomposed into `processSingleReceipt` / `buildNeedsReviewResult` / `shouldGateCreation`; and duplicated logic was unified (one shared VAT normalization replacing three, one `CATEGORY_KEYWORD_MAP` replacing three mapping functions, a `DRY_RUN_TOOL_REGISTRY` replacing a 150-line if/else chain). The full suite passes unchanged.
- **Workflow-prompt clarity and token cleanups.** Named the `accounting_inbox` dimension override arguments; clarified that `reconcile_inter_account_transfers` is the always-registered inter-account execute path (not a hidden fallback) and fixed the `min_confidence` wording; dropped the `classify-unmatched` `JSON.stringify` contradiction (pass the payload object directly); hoisted the untrusted-OCR notice to the top of `receipt-batch`; widened the `book-invoice` duplicate-check window to ±30 days (the tool filters on booking date); allowed non-calendar fiscal years in `month-end`; and slimmed the eight "granular fallback" blocks — dropping the server-internal `EARVELDAJA_EXPOSE_GRANULAR_TOOLS` mechanics the client agent never needs and unifying the phrasing.
- **Dependency upgrades.** `@llamaindex/liteparse` 2.4.0→2.5.0, `typescript` 6→7, `fast-xml-parser` 5.8.0→5.9.3, plus `tsx`, `vitest`, and `@types/node` point releases.

### Fixed
- **Amount locale and VAT correctness.** A negative layout VAT no longer inflates net (it is validated before net is derived, regardless of whether the trio already reconciles); an Estonian dotted date or clock time (`15.03.2026`, `Kell 12.30`) is no longer read as dot-decimal evidence, so a bare `1,899` reads as the 3-decimal `1.90` rather than `1899`; a combined "VAT total + grand total" summary row and multi-rate breakdown rows now bind to the correct column instead of summing the taxable-base column; comma-thousands `1,234` parses as `1234`; and a leading minus is only treated as a sign at start-of-line, not inside a date/range like `2024-01-15`.
- **Supplier/buyer identifier classification.** An identifier appearing in both the buyer and supplier columns is demoted to a distinct needs-review `coordinate_confirmed_echo` rationale instead of being trusted as the supplier's own code, and that echo rescue is now constrained to the **same page** as the selected occurrence (a match on an attached second page no longer rescues it). A distant same-row "Makse" no longer suppresses a genuine buyer "Saaja" marker (horizontal adjacency is now required). Duplicate identifier values map to the correct physical occurrence regardless of text-stream vs geometric ordering (occurrence-ordinal provenance). An echo-only supplier identifier now **gates auto-creation in every execution mode**, routing the receipt to review rather than booking a purchase invoice against a possibly-wrong supplier.
- **`new-supplier` prompt named a nonexistent `create_client` field.** It instructed `is_juridical_entity`, which `create_client` does not accept, while omitting the required `is_physical_entity` — so the call failed at validation. Corrected to `is_physical_entity: false`.
- **Invoicing safety fixes (Oracle + Codex reviews).** Reverse-charge invoices (`reversed_vat_id` set) preserve their totals through `confirm_purchase_invoice` instead of having gross/VAT recomputed; `create_recurring_sale_invoices` defaults to `dry_run`; supplier materialization is deferred until every row-level gate (duplicate, confidence, reverse-charge, currency) passes, so a rejected row can no longer leave an orphaned supplier; zero-VAT invoices with inferred (non-explicit) VAT book with `vat_rate_dropdown='-'` instead of a phantom history rate; a self-match detected after materialization routes to `needs_review`; duplicate detection no longer false-positives on legitimate same-day/same-amount invoices that carry an invoice number; and `suggest_booking` parallelizes its per-candidate API calls.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- **Audit log Markdown readability.** Mutating-operation audit entries now render a short action sentence plus a compact `Field | Value` table with human labels for common details such as reasons, titles, document numbers, files, and related IDs. Journal postings remain tabled, now with optional dimension and base-amount columns, while the hidden `<!-- audit:... -->` metadata used by `get_session_log` filters stays unchanged.

### Fixed
- **Audit log total rows keep net/VAT/gross in one table cell.** Entries with multiple totals now escape the visual separator inside the value cell, so purchase invoices, dividend journals, and owner-expense entries no longer break the two-column Markdown table.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- **Dependency upgrades + security fixes.** Upgraded every outdated dependency (the rest — `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `zod`, `dotenv`, `@toon-format/toon`, `fastest-levenshtein`, `typescript` — were already current). Runtime deps moved within their existing ranges (`@llamaindex/liteparse` 2.0.4→2.4.0, `fast-xml-parser` 5.8.0→5.9.3); the dev toolchain moved to current majors (`vitest` 3→4, `vite` 6→8, `@types/node` 25→26, `tsx` 4.22→4.23). This clears all 4 `npm audit` advisories — 1 **critical** (`vitest` UI-server arbitrary file read/execute), 2 **high** (`vite` Windows path handling), 1 low — every one of them in the dev toolchain; the shipped runtime had no advisories. `vitest` 4 required no config or test migration (the full suite passes unchanged). Note: `vitest` 4 / `vite` 8 require **Node 20.19+ for development and CI**; the published server's runtime still targets Node 18 (`engines.node` unchanged at `>=18.0.0`), so `npx e-arveldaja-mcp` end users are unaffected.
- **Smaller default tool surface (per-session token cost).** The 10 granular constituent tools whose functionality is fully covered by the merged mode-based entry points — `reconcile_transactions`, `auto_confirm_exact_matches` (→ `reconcile_bank_transactions`), `parse_camt053`, `import_camt053` (→ `process_camt053`), `scan_receipt_folder`, `process_receipt_batch` (→ `receipt_batch`), `classify_unmatched_transactions`, `apply_transaction_classifications` (→ `classify_bank_transactions`), `resolve_accounting_review_item`, `prepare_accounting_review_action` (→ `continue_accounting_workflow`) — are no longer registered in `tools/list` by default. The merged tools keep routing to the same handlers internally, so no functionality is lost; set the new **`EARVELDAJA_EXPOSE_GRANULAR_TOOLS=1`** to register them again. `reconcile_inter_account_transfers` stays exposed (the merged tool has no inter-account execute mode). Default surface: 133 → **123** tools (118 with Lightyear disabled; 133 with granular tools exposed). Workflow prompts, error-recovery hints, and review-item suggestions now point at the merged mode-based calls.
- **`lightyear-booking` prompt follows the Lightyear tool group.** When `EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_LIGHTYEAR=1` drops the Lightyear tools, the matching workflow prompt is no longer registered either, so `prompts/list` never advertises a workflow whose tools are missing.
- **Tighter tool and prompt descriptions.** Compressed verbose filler in the heaviest tool descriptions and in-schema parameter docs (`create_purchase_invoice_from_pdf`, `prepare_dividend_package`, `confirm_transaction`, `create_transaction`, `list_transactions`, `get_session_log`, `check_tax_free_limits`, `create_journal`, `create_client`, and the `import-wise` / `prepare-accounting-review-action` prompt dispatch lines) without dropping any contract or safety wording (EXACT-totals/never-recalculate VAT rules, dry-run defaults, approval requirements, untrusted-OCR and dimension-required warnings are all preserved verbatim).
- **Setup/credential tools hidden once connections are configured.** The three credential-management tools — `import_apikey_credentials`, `list_stored_credentials`, `remove_stored_credentials` — are no longer registered in `tools/list` once the server has configured connections; they are only needed to add or rotate credentials and stay registered in setup mode (no connections). `get_setup_instructions` is never gated, so the agent can always explain how to add a connection (its payload documents these tools). Set the new **`EARVELDAJA_EXPOSE_SETUP_TOOLS=1`** to keep them registered in configured mode too (e.g. to add a second company without a restart). Default surface: 123 → **120** tools (115 with Lightyear disabled).
- **Opt-out feature-group flags for lean deployments.** Five new env flags drop whole tool groups a given deployment may not use, mirroring the existing `EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_LIGHTYEAR` semantics (default enabled — set `=1` to drop). They change **nothing** by default; the default surface stays 120 tools. **`EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_TAX_TOOLS=1`** drops the Estonian tax helpers `prepare_dividend_package`, `create_owner_expense_reimbursement`, `check_tax_free_limits` (−3; the statutory tax-rules advisory layer behind `suggest_booking` is untouched — only these user-facing tools are unregistered). **`EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_REFERENCE_ADMIN=1`** drops the reference-data administration tools `create/update/delete_bank_account`, `create/update/delete_invoice_series`, `update_invoice_info`, and the single-record `get_bank_account`/`get_invoice_series` reads (−9), keeping the `list_*`/`get_invoice_info`/`get_vat_info` reads so the configuration is still inspectable. **`EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_ANNUAL_REPORT=1`** drops the year-end tools `prepare_year_end_close`, `generate_annual_report_data`, `execute_year_end_close` (−3). **`EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_SALES=1`** drops the sales-invoicing side — the 11 sale-invoice tools, `create_recurring_sale_invoices`, and receivables aging `compute_receivables_aging` (−13) — for purchase-side-only bookkeeping; the payables-aging report `compute_payables_aging` and every purchase-invoice tool stay. **`EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_PRODUCTS=1`** drops the product-catalog tools `list/get/create/update/deactivate/reactivate/delete_product` (−7); products are chiefly the sale-invoice line-item catalog (purchase items key on `cl_purchase_articles_id` but can also carry an optional `products_id`), so a `DISABLE_SALES` deployment usually sets this too; the flag only removes catalog management (creating either invoice type is unaffected), so the flags are independent. A lean purchase-side-only deployment with every disable flag set (incl. Lightyear) lands near **80** tools; each flag can be toggled independently (e.g. re-enable `DISABLE_ANNUAL_REPORT` only at closing time). `recommend_workflow` now filters its suggestions to the registered surface — it never names a tool an opt-out flag dropped, and it hides a workflow whose tools are all gated (e.g. `lightyear-booking` when Lightyear is off). The static workflow prompts (`company-overview`, `month-end`) are shared across purchase/sales deployments and still mention their full tool set; the agent skips any tool absent from `tools/list`.
- **`extract_pdf_invoice` no longer emits a duplicate `extracted.raw_text`.** The full document/OCR text was returned twice per call — once as `hints.raw_text` and again as `extracted.raw_text` (both are the same parsed text). Only `hints.raw_text` is kept (the booking workflow's documented source of truth; still capped to `MAX_UNTRUSTED_TEXT_CHARS` and wrapped in the per-call untrusted-OCR nonce sandbox). The `extracted` object keeps its structured fields (supplier, totals, and the still-wrapped `description` / `supplier_name`) but no longer carries `raw_text` or its `raw_text_truncated` / `raw_text_length` markers. Saves up to ~5k tokens per extraction on long documents with no loss of information — read the document text from `hints.raw_text`. The tool's own `llm_fallback.guidance` now points field-recovery at `hints.raw_text` to match (the receipt-batch flow, which still carries `extracted.raw_text`, keeps its existing guidance).

### Fixed
- **`prepare_dividend_package` — dividend income tax is now booked as an expense, not a retained-earnings debit.** Previously the tool debited the **full gross** (net dividend + CIT) to retained earnings (Jaotamata kasum, 3020) across two D-lines, which overstated the drain on equity and never recorded the tax on the profit-and-loss statement. Per Estonian GAAP / RTJ, the corporate income tax on a distribution (TuMS § 50, 22/78) is charged against **current-year profit as an income-tax expense** — the P&L "Tulumaks" line — while only the **net dividend** reduces retained earnings. The journal now debits the net dividend to retained earnings and the CIT to an income-tax-expense account (auto-detected as the lowest Kulud account in 8900–8999, matching the annual report's "Tulumaks" mapping; override with the new `income_tax_expense_account` parameter, default 8900). Credits (dividend payable 2370, CIT liability 2540) and the gross-based ÄS § 157 / retained-earnings legality checks are unchanged — net assets still fall by the full gross. The response now includes a `booking` summary showing which accounts were debited.
- **Annual report — FX gain/loss and financial fees no longer drop out of net profit.** `generate_annual_report_data` mapped the "Finantstulud ja -kulud" (financial income/expense) line only to accounts 7200–7699, where nothing is booked. The MCP actually books FX gain (8500), FX loss (8600) and other financial expense (8610) into the 8xxx block, so those amounts fell into `unmapped_accounts` and were excluded from profit-before-tax, net profit, and equity. The mapping now also covers **8000–8899** (Tulumaks stays isolated at 8900–8999) and nets correctly — financial income adds, financial expense subtracts — so a booked FX loss reduces profit instead of being ignored or mis-signed.
- **`prepare_dividend_package` — ÄS § 157(2) restricted-reserve floor.** The net-assets legality check now floors at share capital **+ non-distributable reserves** (reservkapital) rather than share capital alone. Reservkapital is auto-detected on account 3010 (override or extend with the new `restricted_reserve_accounts` parameter); when detected it raises the minimum-net-assets floor and emits a non-blocking notice. The `net_assets_check` echo now reports `restricted_reserves`, `restricted_reserve_accounts`, and `minimum_net_assets`. Distributions that clear bare share capital but not the reserve-inclusive floor are now correctly blocked (overridable with `force=true`). The tool now also warns (non-blocking) when share capital or retained earnings reads as **zero** — the symptom of opening balances entered as "Algbilansi kanded" that the `/journals` API may omit, meaning the § 157 check ran on incomplete data; that caveat is now surfaced on the blocked path too, not just on previews. An explicit `restricted_reserve_accounts` override is validated (and deduped) up front, so a mistyped or absent reserve account errors instead of silently lowering the floor.
- **`book_lightyear_distributions` — platform rewards booked to income, not the FX-loss account.** `reward_account` defaulted to **8600**, which is the FX-loss *expense* account — crediting a platform reward there put non-investment income on the wrong statement line with the wrong sign. It now defaults to **3800** ("Muud äritulud", other operating income). Real investment income (fund distributions, interest) still uses the caller-supplied `income_account`; the reward path is separate. The reward account is only validated when a statement actually contains a reward (or the caller pins `reward_account`), so a dividend/interest-only import no longer fails just because the chart lacks the reward income account.
- **`prepare_dividend_package` — sub-cent and non-positive `net_dividend` hardening.** The net dividend is rounded to cents once up front, so a sub-cent input can never leak an unrounded amount into the booked journal or make the reported gross disagree with the sum posted; a value that rounds to 0.00 EUR (or is ≤ 0) is rejected instead of booking an empty journal. The executed-path `net_assets_check.sufficient` now uses the same tolerance as the block decision (it previously used a stricter bare comparison than the dry-run path).
- **Currency-rounding and purchase-invoice base VAT reconcile to the cent.** `reconcile_currency_rounding` and the foreign-currency purchase-invoice writer now derive `base_vat` as the residual `base_gross − base_net`, so the trio always reconciles exactly instead of drifting a cent when net, vat, and gross are each rounded independently against the FX rate (which could fail the API's sum validation). `compute_account_balance` also rounds its returned balance so an exact-boundary consumer (the § 157 check) can't be flipped by sub-cent float noise.
- **Consistency and documentation fixes.** `reconcile-bank` now books bank/transfer fees to 8610 (consistent with Wise fees) and no longer labels an ≥80 confidence match "safe to auto-confirm" (auto mode gates at ≥90 and still requires approval). `compute_client_debt` and the purchase-VAT fallback now interpolate their default account numbers into descriptions/warnings instead of hard-coding them, and `compute_account_balance`'s `account_id` help text is corrected. Lightyear fee accounts reference the shared `DEFAULT_OTHER_FINANCIAL_EXPENSE_ACCOUNT` constant instead of a repeated literal.
- **`reconcile-bank` books interest credits to the correct financial-income account.** The unmatched-transaction guidance suggested account **6080 "Interest income"** for interest credits, but 6080 sits in the annual report's staff-costs range (6000–6999 "Tööjõukulud"), not the "Finantstulud ja -kulud" mapping (7200–7699 + 8000–8899). Interest income booked there never reaches the financial-income line: depending on how 6080 is typed in the chart, `generate_annual_report_data` either misclassifies the credit as a negative staff cost (a `Kulud` account in 6000–6999) or drops it into `unmapped_accounts` (an income-typed account, since 6xxx has no `Tulud` mapping) — either way it is excluded from the financial result. It now books to **8400 "Intressitulu"** (financial income, 8xxx range — the interest example carried by the Lightyear `income_account` parameter), so bank interest lands on the annual report's financial-income line.
- **Merged workflow tools no longer point their next action at a granular tool that is hidden by default.** When `EARVELDAJA_EXPOSE_GRANULAR_TOOLS` is unset (the default), the 10 granular constituent tools are not in `tools/list`, but the merged entry points still named their granular delegate in the `workflow_action_v1` envelope they return — so `recommended_next_action` / `available_actions` / `approval_previews` pointed at a tool the caller cannot invoke. `reconcile_bank_transactions` (`mode="dry_run_auto_confirm"` → `auto_confirm_exact_matches`), `accounting_inbox` and `continue_accounting_workflow` (→ `parse_camt053` / `import_camt053` / `process_receipt_batch` / `classify_unmatched_transactions`), `classify_bank_transactions` (→ `apply_transaction_classifications`), and `receipt_batch` (→ `process_receipt_batch`) were all affected; only `process_camt053` had a fix (its own bespoke remap). A shared `remapHiddenGranularWorkflowEnvelope` now rewrites every granular tool named in an emitted envelope back to its merged entry point plus the equivalent `mode` (e.g. `auto_confirm_exact_matches {execute:true}` → `reconcile_bank_transactions {mode:"execute_auto_confirm"}`), so the contract only ever names a registered tool. The informational `delegated_tool` field still reports the real internal delegate. (The `process_camt053`-specific remap was replaced by the shared one.)
- **Annual report balance sheet — short-term payables to owners and 11xx financial assets are now classified, not dropped.** `generate_annual_report_data` classified balance-sheet lines by account-number prefix but had two range gaps. (1) On the **liabilities** side, short-term payables in **2100–2199** — which includes the MCP's own default owner-payable account **2110** booked by `create_owner_expense_reimbursement` — matched no current-liability range (only 2300–2399 and 2500–2599 were covered), so they fell into the "Klassifitseerimata kohustused" (unclassified) review line instead of "Lühiajalised kohustused". The current-liability ranges now include 2100–2199, while an explicit long-term name marker still diverts a genuinely non-current 21xx account first. (2) On the **assets** side, the current-asset (Käibevara) prefixes covered 10, 12–16 but **not 11** (short-term financial investments / broker cash, e.g. a Lightyear/Wise settlement account), so an 11xx asset counted toward `total_assets` yet appeared in neither the current nor non-current asset line — silently unbalancing the two asset lines against the total. Prefix **11** is now a current asset. As a safety net mirroring the liabilities' unclassified line, any asset account that still falls outside the current (10–16) / non-current (17–19) ranges now raises a non-blocking warning naming the account instead of vanishing from the asset lines.
- **`accounting_inbox` `recommended_steps` / `next_recommended_action` no longer name a granular tool that is hidden by default.** The #48 remap fixed the `workflow_action_v1` envelope, but the parallel caller-facing `recommended_steps[]` array and `next_recommended_action` object — which sit *outside* that envelope — still named the hidden granular constituents (`parse_camt053`, `import_camt053`, `process_receipt_batch`, `classify_unmatched_transactions`). Under the default exposure those tools are absent from `tools/list`, so the prescriptive "run this next" fields pointed at un-invokable tools. They are now rewritten to the merged entry point plus `mode` (e.g. `parse_camt053 {file_path}` → `process_camt053 {mode:"parse", file_path}`), consistent with the envelope. The rewrite is skipped when `EARVELDAJA_EXPOSE_GRANULAR_TOOLS=1` (the granular names are valid and preferred in that power-user mode), and the past-tense `autopilot.executed_steps` telemetry keeps the real internal delegate (like the envelope's informational `delegated_tool`).
- **`continue_accounting_workflow` owner-expense resolution no longer suggests `create_owner_expense_reimbursement` when the tax tools are disabled.** For an owner-paid-expense receipt review, `resolve_review` / `prepare_action` suggested `create_owner_expense_reimbursement` and named it in `next_step_summary`. That tool belongs to the tax-tool group and is unregistered under `EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_TAX_TOOLS=1`, so on a lean deployment the contract named a tool the caller cannot invoke. The resolver now takes the exposure config into account: when the tax helpers are disabled it drops that tool from `suggested_tools`, points at the always-registered `create_journal` instead, and rewrites the summary to spell out the manual owner-reimbursement booking (debit the business expense, credit the owner-payable account, default 2110) without naming the unavailable tool.
- **`check_tax_free_limits` — representation limit is date-gated (32 € before 2025, 50 € from 2025).** The TuMS § 49 lg 4 representation/entertainment tax-free allowance is **50 €/calendar month only from 2025-01-01**; it was **32 €/month through 2024**. `computeRepresentationCostLimit` hard-coded 50 €, so a check run for a 2024 period over-stated the limit and under-stated the taxable excess (and the 20/78 income tax on it). The monthly figure is now a date-gated timeline (`REPRESENTATION_MONTHLY_LIMIT_TIMELINE` + `representationMonthlyLimitOn`, mirroring the standard-VAT-rate timeline), and `check_tax_free_limits` selects it from `as_of_date` — a cumulative year-to-date figure sits within one calendar year, so its whole accrual uses that year's rate. The `earveldaja://tax_rules` reference now notes the pre-2025 32 €/month figure.
- **`create_owner_expense_reimbursement` — rejects a non-positive `net_amount` or negative VAT.** `net_amount`/`vat_rate`/`vat_amount`/`deductible_vat_amount` only carried a `finite()` schema check plus the existing "looks like a percentage" guard, so a `net_amount` of 0 or a negative value (or a negative VAT input) would post an empty or sign-reversed journal (crediting the expense, debiting the owner-payable). The tool now rejects `net_amount ≤ 0` and any negative `vat_rate` / `vat_amount` / `deductible_vat_amount` up front with a clear error instead of booking nonsense.
- **`prepare_dividend_package` — the ÄS § 157(2) floor cannot be lowered by a negative reserve or share-capital balance.** The net-assets floor (`share capital + restricted reserves`) previously summed the raw balances, so an anomalous **debit** balance on the reservkapital or share-capital account (which should never occur on a clean ledger) would *reduce* the floor and could let an otherwise-unlawful distribution through. Both the share capital and **each restricted reserve individually** are now clamped to ≥ 0 before they enter the floor (clamping only the reserve *total* would still let a negative reserve offset a positive one), so a data anomaly can only make the § 157 block **more** conservative, never less; the `net_assets_check` echo still reports the raw signed `restricted_reserves` so the anomaly stays visible, and the opening-balance caveat warning now also fires on a non-positive (not just zero) share capital.
- **Hotel/hostel/motel suppliers now trigger the KMS § 30 accommodation note.** The entertainment/hospitality detector matched `majutus` / `accommodation` but not a bare hotel name, so a `Hotel …` / `Hostel …` / `Motell …` supplier with no "majutus" in the description slipped past the input-VAT-restriction note. Added the `hotel` / `hostel` / `motel` stems (they also cover the Estonian `hotell` / `motell` inflections) to the shared classifier; the note stays advisory and still states the business-trip accommodation exception.
- **Workflow-prompt corrections — booking guidance now matches the tool surface (prompt/doc text only).** A full review of the `workflows/*.md` runbooks (and their generated `.claude/commands/` mirror) fixed six inconsistencies with the current tools. (1) `reconcile-bank` told the agent to book unmatched bank rows (fees/interest) with a standalone **`create_journal`** — but those are existing PROJECT bank transactions, so a separate journal leaves the bank row unreconciled and risks double-counting the bank movement; it now confirms the transaction against the contra GL account via `confirm_transaction` (an `accounts` distribution), reserving `create_journal` for adjustments not tied to a bank row. (2) `classify-unmatched` suggested fixing a missing `currency_rate` "via `update_transaction`", which is impossible — `update_transaction` is metadata-scoped (bank reference / counterparty / description) and cannot set a rate; the row is now surfaced as blocked with a currency-aware booking path instead. (3) `receipt-batch` sent non-EUR receipts to manual UI work; it now routes them inline through `create_purchase_invoice_from_pdf` / `create_purchase_invoice` with a user-supplied `currency_rate` (matching the inline-confirmation policy), UI as last resort only. (4) `prepare-accounting-review-action` described `save_auto_booking_rule` as updating "the local `accounting-rules.md` file" — corrected to the configured accounting-knowledge store (OKF bundle by default, legacy single file when configured). (5) `setup-credentials` now notes that the credential-management tools are hidden in `configured` mode unless `EARVELDAJA_EXPOSE_SETUP_TOOLS=1`, with an absent-tool fallback. (6) `resolve-accounting-review`'s "ordinary business VAT defaults to deductible" now carries the VAT-registration qualifier (a non-VAT-registered company books gross with no input-VAT deduction).

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Source-document attachment on journals, transactions, and sale invoices** — the `document_user` upload/download/delete capability that previously existed only for purchase invoices is now available across all four document-capable resources via three entity-agnostic tools: `attach_document`, `get_document`, and `delete_document` (each takes `entity_type` ∈ purchase_invoice, sale_invoice, journal, transaction). Estonian RPS law requires a source document on every accounting entry — manual journals (accruals, depreciation, reclassifications, year-end adjustments) and directly-booked bank transactions (card payments, fees) are exactly the entries auditors scrutinise, and `find_missing_documents` already flagged the ones lacking a document but offered no way to attach one. The methods are hoisted onto `BaseResource` (keyed on `basePath`) so coverage is uniform, and `get_document` / `delete_document` also close the previously-unwired read-back and removal of purchase-invoice documents. `get_document` caps the inline base64 payload (~5 MB) and supports `metadata_only=true`, returning name + size instead of the blob for large scans so the MCP transport is not overwhelmed.
- **Edit and delete tools for reference data** — five new tools close the create-only gaps in the reference-data surface: `update_invoice_info` (company invoice settings — contact details, default template, invoice/balance email text and footer), `update_invoice_series` + `delete_invoice_series`, and `update_bank_account` + `delete_bank_account`. Previously these settings could be created and listed through the MCP server but only edited in the e-arveldaja web UI; a renamed bank account, a corrected IBAN/SWIFT, a changed default invoice series, or an updated invoice email template now all stay inside the agent workflow. The update tools are patch-style — pass only the fields to change — and reject an empty patch (or an id-only call) instead of issuing a no-op write. The underlying `readonly.api.ts` methods already existed and invalidate the cache on success.
- **Server-side filters for invoice lists** — `list_purchase_invoices` and `list_sale_invoices` now accept `date_from` / `date_to` (invoice date for purchases, revenue date for sales), `status` (PROJECT/CONFIRMED), `payment_status` (PAID/PARTIALLY_PAID/NOT_PAID), and `clients_id`. These map 1:1 to RIK API query parameters, so the API does both the filtering and the pagination — no client-side page-walking. A `list_purchase_invoices` query for "this quarter's unpaid invoices from supplier X" now fetches one narrow page instead of every invoice.
- **`type` (C/D) filter on `list_transactions`** — the transaction list gains the API's debit/credit `type` filter, joining the existing date / status / client filters.
- **`get_sale_invoice_xml`** — downloads the system-generated machine-readable e-invoice XML (base64) for a sales invoice via `GET /sale_invoices/{id}/xml`. This is the structured Estonian e-arve used for e-invoice exchange and archival, distinct from `get_sale_invoice_document` (the human-readable PDF). Closes the last sale-invoice document endpoint that had no MCP tool.
- **Full RIK API operation coverage** — four tools close the remaining CRUD gaps so every documented RIK e-Financials operation now has an MCP tool: `delete_client` and `delete_product` (hard delete of mistakenly-created master data — they fail if the record is referenced by invoices/transactions, with `deactivate_client`/`deactivate_product` remaining the soft-delete path for in-use records, and they round out the destructive cluster alongside `delete_bank_account` / `delete_invoice_series`); and `get_invoice_series` / `get_bank_account` (single-record reads of the two reference resources that previously had only a list tool). Excludes the operations e-arveldaja performs natively (KMD/VAT return, EMTA prepayment-account entries) and the deliberately metadata-scoped `update_transaction`.

### Changed
- **`list_transactions` and `list_journals` narrow the fetch server-side** — these tools still apply their richer client-side filters (amount range, bank-ref substring, account dimension, operation type, document number), but now push the API-native subset (date range, and for transactions status/type/client) into the underlying request, so the cached full-table walk is only used when no server-side filter applies. Large ledgers querying a single month no longer page through the entire dataset just to filter it down.
- **`upload_invoice_document` replaced by `attach_document`** — the purchase-invoice-only upload tool is superseded by the entity-agnostic `attach_document` (use `entity_type="purchase_invoice"` for the same effect). The internal PDF/receipt booking flows are unaffected (they call the API layer directly). Default tool surface is now 133 (128 with Lightyear disabled).

### Changed (breaking — pre-1.0 public-contract consistency)

Ahead of a 1.0 semver commitment (which freezes tool names, parameter names, enum values, and response shapes), a contract-consistency pass reconciled the inconsistencies a multi-agent audit surfaced. These are breaking for callers of the affected tools:

- **Tool renames.** `restore_client` / `restore_product` → **`reactivate_client`** / **`reactivate_product`** (matches the RIK API `reactivate` verb and the tools' own descriptions).
- **Parameter renames.** Date-range filters are now uniformly **`date_from`** / **`date_to`** across `list_purchase_invoices`, `list_sale_invoices`, `list_transactions`, and `list_journals` (previously a mix of `start_date`/`end_date` and `effective_date_from`/`effective_date_to`). The client filter on `compute_account_balance` / `compute_client_debt` is now **`clients_id`** (was `client_id`; the echoed `entries[].client_id` is likewise `clients_id`). `save_auto_booking_rule` now takes **`liability_accounts_id`** / **`purchase_accounts_id`** (was singular); the persisted accounting-rules format is unchanged.
- **Unified mutation envelope.** Every single-record create/update/delete/confirm/invalidate/deactivate/reactivate/send tool now returns the same `{ ok, action, entity, id?, message, raw }` shape (`raw` carries the original API response); previously most returned the bare `{ code, messages, created_object_id? }`. Batch/aggregate tools, reads, importers, and document tools keep their own documented shapes.
- **Unified list envelope.** `list_transactions` / `list_journals` now always return the superset `{ current_page, total_pages, total_items, per_page, items, filtered_client_side, out_of_range }` regardless of whether a client-side filter is active (the server-only path sets `filtered_client_side: false`), instead of emitting different shapes per path.
- **Structured / typed audit tooling.** `list_audit_logs` returns JSON (`{ items, count, hint }`) instead of Markdown prose; `search_client` returns the `{ ok, action, entity, count, raw }` object envelope instead of a bare array; and `get_session_log`'s `entity_type` / `action` filters are now validated enums covering the full vocabulary the audit writer emits (typos are rejected instead of silently matching nothing).
- **`compute_account_balance` `account_id` clarified.** The description now states it expects the account database `id` from `list_accounts`, not the account code (e.g. 2110) — the handler always matched on `id`; the old wording was misleading. It now also accepts string ids.
- **`create_client` person-type now required.** `is_physical_entity` is now a required boolean (`true` = natural person, `false` = legal entity); the redundant `is_juridical_entity` input was removed and is derived as its complement. The RIK API rejects client creation without a person-type (`409 "Please choose if it is a natural or a juridical person."`), so requiring it converts an opaque upstream error into a clear validation error at call time. Legal entities still also require a registry `code`. (Verified end-to-end against the demo API.)

### Security
- **Untrusted-text wrapping extended to the remaining importer/document surfaces** — a multi-agent prompt-injection audit found a few externally-controlled strings that were echoed into MCP output without the `wrapUntrustedOcr` nonce boundary. Now wrapped: the free-text `reference`/`name` columns in `parse_lightyear_statement` and `parse_lightyear_capital_gains` (broker CSV), the `supplier_name` in `import_wise_transactions` invoice-fix candidates (Wise CSV), and the stored document filename returned by `get_document` (uploaded-document metadata). These join the already-wrapped OCR/receipt fields so no path relays attacker-supplied text to a downstream LLM as trusted instructions.
- **Stored API key id masked in `list_stored_credentials`** — the key id (the cleartext identifier component of the HMAC message, never the secret) is now masked (first/last few characters) before being emitted, so a stable tenant/account identifier is not relayed verbatim to a third-party LLM. `target`/`name`/`server`/`isDefault` still uniquely identify a block for `remove_stored_credentials`.
- **OCR `raw_text` capped before inlining** — `extract_pdf_invoice` and the receipt-batch output now truncate the OCR blob to a fixed character budget (~20k chars) with a `raw_text_truncated` / `raw_text_length` marker, so a pathological or maliciously oversized document cannot flood the consuming LLM's context. Booking uses the structured `extracted` fields, not the raw blob.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- **EMTA tax payments now default to the EMTA prepayment account** — bank transfers to the Estonian Tax and Customs Board (EMTA / Maksu- ja Tolliamet) are booked to the EMTA prepayment account (ettemaksukonto, account 1516) by default, instead of to a tax-expense account via "maks"/"tax" keyword matching. A transfer to EMTA is a top-up of the prepayment account (Debit 1516 / Credit bank); the tax-expense entries that draw it down are created by e-arveldaja itself from the EMTA prepayment-account statement (Aruandlus → EMTA ettemaksukonto kanded), not from the bank payment. The `tax_payments` transaction classification (review-only — never auto-booked) now fixes the suggested contra account to the EMTA prepayment account and suggests no purchase article. This is a hard default that takes precedence over supplier history and saved auto-booking rules, so a past mis-booking for the same counterparty cannot silently re-route the payment. The account is resolved by exact id first, then a constrained name match (asset-typed, EMTA-named `ettemaksukonto`, never a clearing or liability account); when it cannot be located, no account id is emitted and the suggestion carries a "could not locate the EMTA prepayment account" note. The `tax_payments` review guidance text is aligned to match (new `EMTA_PREPAYMENT_ACCOUNT` constant; validated by an adversarial code review).
- **Unified the expense VAT-restriction keyword detector** — the passenger-car and entertainment/hospitality keyword matching used for input-VAT deduction decisions now lives in a single `classifyExpenseForVat` in `src/estonian-tax-rules.ts`, consumed by `detectVatDeductionNotes` (`suggest_booking` tax_notes), `buildOwnerExpenseVatReviewGuidance` (receipt/owner-expense review), and `requiresOwnerExpenseVatReview` (`create_owner_expense_reimbursement`). Previously these were three near-duplicate regexes that could drift apart; the shared detector uses the union of their keywords, so detection is slightly broader (e.g. catering, meelelahutus, banquet, inflected accommodation). The `KMS § 30` note now also states the deductible business-trip (lähetus) accommodation exception. (The separate food/representation keyword lists used for purchase-article suggestion are a different concern and left unchanged.)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Estonian input-VAT deduction notes in `suggest_booking`** — the purchase-booking suggestion now returns a `tax_notes` array that flags deterministic deduction restrictions for the supplier/description: `KMS § 30` (külaliste vastuvõtt / esinduskulu — input VAT not deductible, plus the `TuMS § 49 lg 4` representation limit of 50 €/month + 2% of payroll) and `KMS § 30 lg 4` (M1 passenger-car costs — input VAT capped at 50%). Each note carries `code`, `severity`, `title`, `detail`, and statutory `basis`; the booking workflow prompt now requires surfacing every note on the approval card rather than silently applying or ignoring it. Rules live in a new date-gated `src/estonian-tax-rules.ts` dataset (standard VAT-rate timeline 20→22%→24% with effective dates, current reduced rates, and the deduction detectors) so the figures have a single, maintainable source verified against EMTA/Riigi Teataja. Detection runs only over plain strings, so OCR-derived input is never followed as instructions.
- **Date-aware standard-VAT-rate check in `validate_invoice_data`** — a line carrying a standard-looking rate (20/22/24%) that does not match the standard rate in force on the invoice date (via the new rate timeline) now raises a warning, catching OCR misreads and wrong-period bookings around the 1.01.2024 and 1.07.2025 rate changes. Reduced/zero rates (0/9/13%) are unaffected, and the check no-ops when no invoice date is supplied.
- **`earveldaja://tax_rules` reference resource** — a read-only, server-authored MCP resource exposing the full Estonian tax dataset: the standard VAT-rate timeline, current reduced rates, and the deduction/limit rules (`KMS § 30`, `KMS § 30 lg 4`, `TuMS § 49 lg 4` representation 50 €+2%, `TuMS § 49 lg 2` donations 3%/10% — extended through 31.12.2027). Figures re-verified against EMTA (no 2026 changes).
- **`check_tax_free_limits` tool** — computes the cumulative `TuMS § 49` tax-free limits (representation costs 50 €/month + 2% of payroll; donations 3% of payroll or 10% of prior-year profit, taxpayer's choice) and the 22/78 income tax on any excess. A pure calculator over caller-supplied year-to-date figures (payroll from the TSD declaration, prior-year profit from `compute_profit_and_loss`) — it deliberately does not infer account mappings from the ledger. The default tool surface is now 121 (116 with Lightyear disabled).

### Changed
- **Leaner tool metadata (smaller per-session token cost)** — trimmed duplicated and relocatable prose from the always-loaded `tools/list` surface (tool descriptions and Zod property descriptions) across the full tool set, without changing any tool behavior or schema constraints. Workflow-sequencing/rationale narrative moved to the on-demand workflow prompts; compact direct-call invariants (exact invoice `vat_price`/`gross_price`, `currency_rate` direction, dimensioned-account `related_sub_id`, dry-run/execute and IRREVERSIBLE-confirm semantics, dividend net-assets block, Lightyear FIFO cost-basis requirement) stay on the tools themselves. Reduces the `tools/list` payload by ~12.7% (117.7 KB → 102.8 KB) with the full test suite green and new tests asserting the retained direct-call invariants remain in `tools/list`.
- **Optional Lightyear tool group** — set `EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_LIGHTYEAR=1` to skip registering the Lightyear investment tools (`book_lightyear_*`, `parse_lightyear_*`, `lightyear_portfolio_summary`) when a company does not track investments. Disabling the group drops 5 tools from the default surface (121 → 116; `tools/list` roughly 100.7 KB → 95.3 KB as measured for that change, ~19% below the original baseline).

### Removed
- **Redundant accounting-inbox alias tools** — `prepare_accounting_inbox` and `run_accounting_inbox_dry_runs` were exact aliases of `accounting_inbox` with `mode="scan"` / `mode="dry_run"`. They have been removed to cut per-session token cost; call `accounting_inbox` with the matching `mode` instead (no behaviour change). This removal brought the default tool surface to 120 (before the `check_tax_free_limits` addition above).

## [0.15.1] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- **Prompt guidance quality pass** — tightened LLM-facing workflow instructions for Wise import approvals, purchase-invoice currency booking, bank reconciliation distribution payloads, prompt-injection boundaries, CAMT duplicate cleanup, reverse-charge evidence, and merged workflow entry points.

### Fixed
- **Shipped `.claude/commands/*.md` prompts re-synced with their `workflows/*.md` sources** — the prompt-quality pass updated the workflow sources but left the five generated command mirrors (book-invoice, import-camt, import-wise, receipt-batch, reconcile-bank) stale; they are regenerated so both prompt surfaces ship identical guidance, and the mirror-sync test guard was restored.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Accounting-rules storage now uses Open Knowledge Format (OKF) bundles** — company-specific accounting rules (auto-booking counterparty defaults, owner-expense VAT policy, annual-report liability/cash-flow/profit overrides) are stored as an OKF v0.1 bundle: a directory of one-concept-per-file markdown documents with YAML frontmatter, plus reserved `index.md` (table of contents) and `log.md` (append-only change history). The directory location is chosen by `chooseDefaultBundleStorage()` (existing project-root rules are kept in place, otherwise a fresh install defaults to the global config dir — see "Changed" below) and can be pointed anywhere with the new `EARVELDAJA_RULES_DIR` environment variable. The agent-facing read API is unchanged, so `suggest_booking`/receipt/annual-report consumers are unaffected. `migrateLegacyRulesToBundle()` is exported for tooling.
- **Browsable accounting-knowledge MCP resources** — the OKF bundle is exposed as MCP resources: `earveldaja://accounting_knowledge` returns the bundle index/table of contents, and `earveldaja://accounting_knowledge/{path}` returns an individual concept file (the `resources/list` callback enumerates the current concepts, including `log.md`, so newly saved rules appear without a restart). Concept reads are hardened against path traversal (resolved paths, symlinks included, must stay inside the bundle and end in `.md`). Like the other reference-data resources, this operator-curated configuration is treated as trusted and is not wrapped in the untrusted-OCR sandbox.
- **Cross-process write lock for shared bundles** — a single rule write touches three files (the concept, `log.md`, and a regenerated `index.md`). When several MCP clients share one `EARVELDAJA_RULES_DIR`, the mutating cycle is now serialized with an `O_EXCL` lock file at `<dir>.lock` so two server processes cannot interleave and leave the index out of sync with the concepts. The lock is a sibling of the bundle dir (so it never interferes with the atomic staging→rename migration) and re-entrant within a process. Mutual exclusion is purely `openSync(wx)` (O_EXCL); a lock left behind by a crashed holder is reclaimed only when that holder's pid is provably dead (`process.kill(pid, 0)` → ESRCH — never from a slow live writer), via a guard-serialized removal that re-confirms the exact dead owner token immediately before deleting, so a fresh successor's lock can never be stolen or deleted. Release likewise only removes the lock while it still carries our token.

### Changed
- **Auto-booking rule writes replaced the brittle in-place markdown-table editor** — saving a rule now writes a single `auto-booking/<slug>.md` concept file and appends a dated `log.md` entry instead of splicing table rows, which is more robust and produces clean per-rule git diffs.
- **Legacy single-file `accounting-rules.md` is migrated automatically and non-destructively** — when a bundle does not yet exist, the legacy file is still read in place; on the first rule write it is converted into the bundle and moved aside to `accounting-rules.md.migrated` (never deleted) so it cannot silently diverge from the bundle. Setting `EARVELDAJA_RULES_FILE` keeps the old single-file behaviour byte-for-byte for anyone who wants to opt out.
- **Robustness hardening (code-review follow-ups)** — auto-booking lookup now resolves the most specific (longest) matching rule deterministically, independent of file/row ordering; migration is atomic (the bundle is built in a staging dir and renamed into place); a directory is treated as the authoritative rule source only when it holds a real concept file (a bare `index.md`/`log.md`-only scaffold or an empty folder no longer shadows the legacy `accounting-rules.md`); migration parses the legacy file strictly and refuses to archive the source if it could not be read/parsed, so a corrupt file is never silently emptied; frontmatter scalars collapse newlines and quote YAML-ambiguous string values (e.g. `true`, `123`, dates) so OCR-derived text can neither break the block nor be re-typed by external YAML consumers; degenerate slugs are disambiguated with a stable hash; and knowledge-resource concept paths are percent-encoded and guarded against null bytes and fs errors.

- **Stable default location for the accounting-knowledge bundle** — when neither `EARVELDAJA_RULES_DIR` nor `EARVELDAJA_RULES_FILE` is set, the default is now chosen by `chooseDefaultBundleStorage()`: an existing project-root bundle or legacy `accounting-rules.md` is kept in place (so nobody's rules move), but a fresh install defaults to the per-user global config dir (`~/.config/e-arveldaja-mcp/accounting-rules`, or the platform equivalent — the same convention credentials use) instead of a path next to the install directory. This keeps the knowledge host-stable across reinstalls and shareable between MCP clients.

### Documentation
- **Documented the accounting-knowledge storage location** — `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` now describe the `EARVELDAJA_RULES_DIR` (OKF bundle override, recommended for multi-company setups) and `EARVELDAJA_RULES_FILE` (legacy single-file mode) environment variables, the new default-location resolution, and the shared-bundle write lock.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Manual cache refresh controls** — added `clear_cache` for clearing cached e-arveldaja API/reference data after changes made directly in the web UI. Balance and reporting tools now also accept `fresh: true` to clear runtime caches before computing account balances, client positions, trial balances, balance sheets, profit/loss reports, and month-end checklist data.

### Changed
- **Workflow guidance for fresh reporting data** — updated company-overview and month-end workflow prompts to call `clear_cache` or pass `fresh: true` when the user asks for fresh numbers after editing data in e-arveldaja.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **CAMT duplicate detection survives dropped bank metadata** — `import_camt053` now stores a compact CAMT metadata marker in the writable transaction description when the e-arveldaja API drops `bank_ref_number` or `bank_account_no`. Long bank references are stored as a stable SHA-256 lookup key, and the marker preserves the counterparty IBAN when both full values cannot fit inside the API's 150-character description limit. Re-importing the same CAMT statement now skips the prior transaction instead of creating a duplicate.
- **CAMT possible-duplicate review keeps marker-only candidates visible** — marker metadata is no longer treated as a broad bank-reference duplicate on its own. If a marker-bearing existing transaction fails the exact CAMT duplicate key, it remains in `needs_review` when amount/date/counterparty signals still match, so operators can link or clean it up instead of silently creating a second PROJECT row.
- **TOON 2.3 response compatibility** — MCP responses still prefer TOON for compact output, but now fall back to JSON when the current TOON encoder produces text its decoder rejects, such as sandboxed multiline OCR/CAMT marker strings. This keeps downstream wrappers and tests parseable while preserving untrusted OCR delimiters verbatim.
- **Purchase-invoice notes no longer default to the source filename** — the `book-invoice` workflow prompt and the `create_purchase_invoice_from_pdf` `notes` parameter no longer suggest storing the source document filename in the notes field. The document is already uploaded and attached to the invoice, so the notes field is left empty by default and reserved for genuinely useful context such as assumptions or manual adjustments. The booking approval card now also explicitly flags when a new supplier record was auto-created during the flow.

### Changed
- **Dependency refresh for the release** — updated direct runtime and dev dependencies, including LiteParse 2.0.4, MCP SDK 1.29.0, TOON 2.3.0, Zod 4.4.3, TypeScript 6.0.3, dotenv 17.4.2, fast-xml-parser 5.8.0, and tsx 4.22.4. The Vitest/Vite test stack is pinned to Node-18-compatible versions (Vitest 3.2.4, Vite 6.4.2) so the locked toolchain honours the advertised `engines.node >=18.0.0` instead of silently requiring Node 20. LiteParse parsing now uses the v2 single-argument `parse(input)` API, and Zod record schemas use the v4 two-argument form.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-05-09

### Changed
- **Workflow prompt UX** — expanded `recommend_workflow` to cover all 15 workflow prompts, including setup, review continuation, month-end, supplier creation, company overview, and Lightyear booking. Workflow action labels now use accounting-language next steps instead of generic `Run <tool>` labels, and MCP workflow prompts include a shared user-facing response contract for done items, approval cards, one-decision questions, accountant-review items, and next recommended actions.
- **Prompt approval guidance** — refreshed the shipped workflow prompts and generated Claude commands with clearer user-facing phases, approval-card contents, fallback-tool wording, and an explicit approval gate before creating new supplier records. `setup-e-arveldaja` now comes from the same canonical workflow prompt source as the other shipped prompts.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **`reconcile_currency_rounding` tool** — scans `PARTIALLY_PAID` purchase invoices created from foreign-currency bookings and resolves the residual EUR difference. Sub-0.10 EUR diffs are patched in place on the invoice; 0.10–1.00 EUR diffs are booked as FX kursivahe journals (D 2310 / C 8500 when liability is overstated, D 8600 / C 2310 when understated); >1.00 EUR diffs are surfaced for review and never auto-applied. Dry-run mode never mutates anything. (#40)

### Fixed
- **Wise card-payment FX rate lock for foreign-currency invoices** — foreign-currency purchase invoices paid via Wise card kept landing in `PARTIALLY_PAID` because the EUR booking guessed a rate that did not match Wise's actual conversion. `import_wise_transactions` now matches eligible Wise rows to unpaid invoices on supplier + amount + 5-day window and patches `base_gross_price` / `currency_rate` to the Wise settlement (foreign-currency lock) or fixes legacy EUR bookings within ±0.10 EUR. The importer skips invoices that already match the Wise rate (idempotent re-import) and refuses to act when one Wise row hits multiple unpaid invoices. (#40)
- **Receipt supplier country inference guard** — supplier resolution now refuses to infer `cl_code_country` from receipt OCR alone when the deterministic signals are weak, preventing wrong-country defaults from leaking into auto-created clients and downstream reverse-charge logic.
- **Receipt dry-run autopilot blocking** — the accounting inbox autopilot path now consumes the receipt dry-run preview correctly instead of stalling when a batch produces only `dry_run_preview` rows.
- **Receipt inbox auto-booking guards for foreign currency** — `process_receipt_batch` (and its `receipt_batch` wrapper) now returns `needs_review` for any receipt whose currency is not EUR instead of creating a purchase invoice in the source currency without a conversion rate. `apply_transaction_classifications` mirrors the guard at the bank-transaction level: a per-row note explains that the row was skipped because the transaction has no `currency_rate`, while the rest of the group still proceeds.
- **Bank-match arbitration for tied confidence** — `findBestTransactionMatch` no longer silently picks one candidate when multiple bank transactions tie at the top confidence score. The booking flow now records `N candidates tied at confidence X; no candidate auto-selected` in the result notes, and the workflow prompt instructs the agent to surface the tied set for the user to choose from rather than guess.
- **`apply_transaction_classifications` group status semantics** — a group flips to `applied` only when every attempted invoice creation succeeded (legitimately-skipped rows like non-EUR or unresolved-supplier no longer count against the denominator and stop wrongly marking the whole group as `failed`). When a group flips to `failed` after one or more rows were already booked successfully, the result now includes a `Group reported as failed; the following transactions were already booked successfully and were left in place: …` note so the operator does not assume the partial work was rolled back.
- **`receipt_batch` `mode=scan` honors date filters** — `scan_receipt_folder` (and the merged `receipt_batch mode=scan`) now accept and forward `date_from` / `date_to` to the directory scan instead of silently ignoring them.
- **`month_end_close_checklist` overdue check survives null `term_days`** — the upstream API occasionally returns `term_days` as null/undefined for term-less invoices, which made `getUTCDate() + undefined` produce NaN and silently drop genuinely overdue invoices from the report. Missing `term_days` is now treated as 0-day terms and a per-invoice warning surfaces in the result so the operator notices.
- **Lightyear `fee_eur / fx_rate` divide guard** — a corrupted Lightyear CSV row with a tiny `fx_rate` (e.g. `1e-6`) used to produce a five-figure phantom EUR fee that silently inflated the booked cost basis and realized gain/loss across `book_lightyear_trades`, `book_lightyear_distributions`, and `lightyear_portfolio_summary`. A shared `tradeFeeInEur` helper now rejects NaN, ±Infinity, zero, negative, and sub-`1e-4` rates and returns the source fee unchanged in those cases.

### Changed
- **Foreign-currency purchase invoice creation accepts an explicit FX rate** — `create_purchase_invoice` and `create_purchase_invoice_from_pdf` now accept `currency_rate` and `base_net_price` / `base_vat_price` / `base_gross_price`. `createAndSetTotals` fails fast on a foreign-currency invoice that lacks a rate and auto-derives the missing `base_*` fields from the supplied rate when omitted, so the EUR liability matches the Wise card-payment settlement out of the box. (#40)
- **`validate_invoice_data` warns about missing FX rate on foreign-currency invoices** — when `cl_currencies_id` is not EUR and no `currency_rate` / `base_net_price` is supplied, the validator now emits a warning pointing at the Wise CSV settlement rate as the source of truth. (#40)
- **`extract_pdf_invoice` flags non-EUR currencies in the OCR output** — when the PDF extractor detects a foreign currency, the response now carries an explicit warning telling the caller to source the conversion rate from the Wise CSV before booking, so the booking step does not get to invent a rate from thin air. (#40)
- **Workflow prompts honor the inline-confirmation policy** — `classify-unmatched`, `month-end`, `receipt-batch`, `import-wise`, and `reconcile-bank` step 5 now offer the next concrete tool call (`confirm_transaction`, `confirm_purchase_invoice`, `create_journal`, etc.) inline as a yes/no question per item instead of closing with "go fix this in the e-arveldaja UI". Workflows also surface the new receipt-inbox semantics: non-EUR receipt skip reasons, tied-bank-match notes, and the partial-success-left-in-place group note.
- **`Transaction.currency_rate` type alignment with the API** — the upstream RIK API serializes optional numeric fields as JSON null but the five `currency_rate` sites in `src/types/api.ts` declared `?: number`. Widened to `number | null` so callers that gate on `=== undefined` are forced to acknowledge null at the type level, and updated the `matchScore` helper signature so existing call sites still type-check.
- **Receipt inbox service split** — split receipt batch file discovery, booking execution, bank/duplicate matching, output sanitization, and summary assembly into focused modules while keeping the public MCP tool shape stable. (#28)
- **Accounting workflow test fixtures** — added shared typed MCP server/API fixture builders for workflow tests and migrated accounting inbox, CAMT import, and receipt wrapper setup code away from repeated inline mocks. (#30)
- **Workflow prompt source of truth** — MCP workflow prompts now append the canonical packaged `workflows/*.md` source, Claude command prompts are generated from those workflow files, and release validation fails if generated command prompt artifacts drift. (#31)
- **Workflow tool surface cleanup** — extracted reference-data registrations from `crud-tools.ts` into a focused module with registration snapshot coverage, and updated shipped workflow docs to prefer the merged `accounting_inbox` / `continue_accounting_workflow` / `receipt_batch` entry points while keeping older focused tools documented as compatibility primitives. (#39)
- **CAMT and receipt entry points** — added `process_camt053` and `receipt_batch` as mode-based wrappers over the existing parse/import/receipt tools. Existing focused CAMT and receipt tools stay registered for compatibility. (#36)
- **Bank workflow entry points** — added `reconcile_bank_transactions` and `classify_bank_transactions` as mode-based wrappers over the existing reconciliation, auto-confirm, inter-account transfer, and unmatched classification tools. Existing focused tool names stay registered for compatibility. (#38)

## [0.13.1] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Year-end close current-year profit account** — changed the default current-year profit/loss account from `3310` to the e-arveldaja standard `2970`, and added an `accounting-rules.md` override (`Current year profit account: ...`) for companies with custom charts of accounts. The year-end close proposal, validation, annual report equity mapping, warnings, and tests now use the resolved account consistently.
- **Opening balance API coverage warning** — added a visible warning to `compute_balance_sheet`, `compute_account_balance`, `compute_trial_balance`, `compute_profit_and_loss`, and `list_journals` that e-arveldaja's separate "Algbilansi kanded" section is not exposed by the documented `/journals` API data available to the MCP server. Documented the API gap and requested behavior in `spec_problems.md`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **`process_receipt_batch` approval boundary for #19** — added explicit `execution_mode` phases: `dry_run`, `create`, and `create_and_confirm`. Legacy `execute=true` now maps to `execution_mode="create"` with a warning, so batch receipt processing creates/uploads PROJECT purchase invoices but leaves confirmation and bank matching behind a separate approval step. Receipt approval previews and prompts now recommend `execution_mode="create"` instead of the old one-shot create+confirm path.
- **Lightyear capital-gains export drift** — `parse_lightyear_capital_gains` now reads required columns by header name instead of fixed positions, so newer Lightyear FIFO exports that insert `Asset Class` before `Fees (EUR)` parse correctly while the legacy 10-column export remains supported.
- **Wise date filter validation** — `import_wise_transactions` now rejects malformed `date_from` / `date_to` values and reversed ranges before reading or creating transactions, preventing typoed filters from silently producing partial or surprising imports.

## [0.12.6] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Shipped workflow prompt drift** — synced the packaged `book-invoice`, `lightyear-booking`, and `reconcile-bank` workflow/Claude command docs with the current tool behavior and safety rails. The prompts now include the VAT-registration precheck, more precise reverse-charge guidance, required Lightyear distribution account inputs, external-file data handling, and the current inter-account transfer duplicate-cleanup contract.
- **Receipt inbox Windows path and stale transaction status handling** — folder validation now uses the shared path-root containment helper so Windows-style allowed child folders are accepted correctly. `apply_transaction_classifications` now reports `failed` instead of `applied` when invoice creation was attempted but stale transaction detection invalidated the draft and left no invoice or transaction link behind.

## [0.12.5] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Claude Code MCP transport still dropped on fast paginated tools after 0.12.3** — the 100 ms throttle introduced in 0.12.3 only suppressed the *second and later* `reportProgress` calls within an invocation. The first emit always passed (the throttle map's default is 0, so `Date.now() - 0` is far larger than 100 ms), so any tool whose first `await reportProgress(...)` fired right after a fast page-1 fetch still raced its own response. Production logs from 2026-04-26 captured three drops in one session (`list_transactions`, `detect_duplicate_purchase_invoice`, `reconcile_inter_account_transfers`) where the tool completed in 7–42 ms and the leading `progress: 0` notification arrived at the client *after* the response had cleared the progressToken — Claude Code closed the stdio transport and the server had to reconnect. The throttle baseline is now pre-seeded to invocation start via a new `runWithExtra` wrapper around `toolExtraStorage.run`, so tools that finish inside the 100 ms window emit zero progress notifications. Slow tools (>100 ms first-emit latency) still report progress as before. (#26)

## [0.12.4] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Optional stderr debug log file** — set `EARVELDAJA_LOG_FILE=/path/to/mcp.err.log` to tee everything the server writes to stderr (startup warnings, fatal errors, and the structured logger output once the MCP transport is up) into the given file in append mode (`0o600`). Off by default. Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows). Useful when the MCP host swallows stderr. The path is required to be a regular file — pipes, devices, sockets, `/dev/stdout`, and `/proc/self/fd/*` are refused with a warning so the tee cannot corrupt the MCP stdio transport.

### Fixed
- **`process_receipt_batch` dry-run preview lied about what `execute=true` would do** — the contract gate (#19) for `low` confidence and `foreign_reverse_charge_default_unverified` only ran when `execute=true`. In dry-run mode, gated rows were still labelled `dry_run_preview` and surfaced in the approval card, even though running with `execute=true` would refuse them and route to review. The gate now mirrors in both modes, so dry-run output and approval previews truthfully reflect what execution would do. Existing summary fields and review wording adapt (`Auto-create would be skipped: ...` in dry-run vs `Auto-create skipped: ...` on execute).
- **`recommend_workflow` `receipt-batch` next-action was not directly runnable** — the suggested args for `process_receipt_batch` omitted the required `accounts_dimensions_id`, so the recommendation failed schema validation when invoked verbatim. Now includes the placeholder `<bank account dimension id used when matching bank transactions>`, matching the CAMT/Wise next-action shape.

### Changed
- **Reduced MCP response token cost** — two changes targeting the heaviest response paths:
  - `tool-response.ts` envelope no longer spreads `raw` fields at the root in addition to keeping the `raw:` payload. Previously every `toolResponse(...)` call duplicated the full API payload (~2× envelope size). Consumers now read API fields under `result.raw.*`; envelope meta (`ok`, `action`, `entity`, `id`, `found`, `message`, `warnings`, `next_actions`) and explicit `extra` fields stay at the root.
  - `list_clients`, `list_products`, `list_journals`, `list_transactions`, `list_sale_invoices`, `list_purchase_invoices` now default to a brief view (`view: "brief" | "full"`, default `brief`) that returns only triage fields (id + key business fields). Pass `view="full"` for the legacy full payload, or use the matching `get_*` tool for full detail of a specific row. Measured TOON-encoded reduction on synthetic 30-row payloads: clients ~93%, transactions ~85%, sale_invoices ~73%; brief output also re-enables TOON tabular form by stripping nested objects/arrays, compounding the saving. Internal tools (`accounting-inbox`, `bank-reconciliation`, `analyze-unconfirmed`, etc.) call the API layer directly and are unaffected.

## [0.12.3] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Long-running tools crashed the Claude Code MCP transport with "Received a progress notification for an unknown token"** — call sites in `camt-import`, `bank-reconciliation`, `receipt-inbox`, `wise-import`, `analyze-unconfirmed`, `lightyear-investments`, and `api/base-resource` invoked `reportProgress` once per item across loops of 50–69+ entries. Each emit was awaited but landed in the OS stdio buffer; on slow clients the response was matched and the progressToken handler cleared *before* the trailing notifications were drained, and Claude Code treats any "unknown token" progress notification as a fatal transport error (closes the stdio pipe; the user must reconnect via `/mcp`). `reportProgress` now (a) throttles to at most one notification per 100 ms within an invocation, (b) skips the trailing `progress >= total` emit since the response itself signals completion, and (c) honors a `EARVELDAJA_DISABLE_PROGRESS=1` env-var kill switch for environments still affected. Throttle state is per-invocation (WeakMap keyed by the SDK's tool extra), so concurrent tool calls and back-to-back invocations never share a window.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Booking suggestion miscoding SaaS as Buildings** (closes #17) — `findAccountByKeywords` used `String.prototype.includes`, so the keyword `"it"` matched as a substring of `"Ehitised"` (Buildings, id=1810) and routed OpenAI/ChatGPT/Anthropic receipts into a fixed-asset acquisition account. The matcher is now a prefix-at-word-boundary regex (Unicode `\p{L}\p{N}` boundaries so Estonian suffixes like `muud`/`muude` still match `muu`), and any `is_fixed_asset` account is filtered out of keyword/fallback paths — even when reached via a misconfigured purchase-article's `accounts_id`. The keyword map is expanded for OpenAI / ChatGPT / Anthropic / Claude / Cursor and prefers `tarkvara` / `internet` / `sideteenus` keys before generic ones.
- **Reverse-charge VAT not auto-detected for foreign suppliers** (closes #18) — `BookingSuggestion` gains a `reverse_charge_reason` field. `applyReverseChargeAutoDetection` (a) preserves any `reversed_vat_id` already set by supplier history / local rules; (b) auto-applies reverse-charge when an explicit phrase matches in OCR text — Estonian `pöördmaksustamise alusel`, English `reverse charge`, German `Steuerschuldnerschaft des Leistungsempfängers`, French `autoliquidation`; (c) falls back to a foreign-supplier default when the active company is VAT-registered AND the resolved supplier country is not `EST`. Decisions are surfaced as human-readable notes plus `reverse_charge_reason` for downstream review.
- **process_receipt_batch contract gate** (closes #19) — added per-row in-batch duplicate detection (same supplier + invoice number across two files in the same scan) and a confidence-based contract gate: rows whose final `llm_fallback.confidence` is `low` are routed to `needs_review` even when `execute=true`, so silent miscoding is no longer possible through the auto-create+confirm path. `medium` and `high` rows behave as before.
- **`llm_fallback.recommended` was a presence check, not a plausibility check** (closes #20) — `summarizeInvoiceExtraction` now returns `confidence: "low" | "medium" | "high"` and `confidence_signals: string[]` alongside the legacy `recommended` flag. Confidence is downgraded to `low` on any of: missing required fields, currency-defaulted (#16), self-VAT-on-page (#14), in-batch duplicate invoice number (#19), or reverse-charge phrase present but the booking suggestion did not flag it (#18); to `medium` on supplier-resolution failure or improbable fixed-asset (#17), or when the booking source was not supplier history. `recommended` is now a derived alias (`recommended === confidence !== "high"`) so existing callers keep working.
- **Self-match guard misses own-company client without VAT** (closes #22) — `SupplierResolutionOptions.ownCompanyRegistryCode` accepts the active company's reg code as a second self-match signal alongside `ownCompanyVat`. `process_receipt_batch` derives the value heuristically: a client matching `/vat_info` by VAT, or — when the active company's record was created before VAT registration — a unique normalized-name match against `/invoice_info.invoice_company_name`. The previewed new client also strips a `supplier_reg_code` that equals our own, mirroring the VAT scrub from #14. `getInvoiceInfo` is consumed defensively so older test stubs that don't implement it still work.
- **Payment receipt result lacked machine-readable invoice cross-reference** (closes #23) — `ReceiptBatchFileResult.referenced_invoice` is now a typed field populated when `classification === "payment_receipt"`. It carries the receipt's referenced invoice number, a `matched: boolean`, and (when matched) `matched_invoice_id` resolved against existing live (non-DELETED/INVALIDATED) purchase invoices. Auto-attach via `upload_invoice_document` and similar follow-ups can consume the cross-reference programmatically instead of parsing it back out of the human note.
- **Self-VAT supplier resolution** (closes #14) — when an invoice prints only the buyer's VAT (e.g. Anthropic receipts that carry no supplier VAT), the deterministic extractor used to pick up the buyer's own EE-VAT and resolve the supplier to the active company itself. `extractVatNumber` now accepts an `exclude` option, `extractPdfIdentifiers` / `extractReceiptFieldsFromText` accept `ownCompanyVat`, and `resolveSupplierInternal` refuses any registry-code / VAT / fuzzy-name match that resolves to a client whose VAT equals the active company's. The previewed new-client never carries the buyer's own VAT. `process_receipt_batch` now reads `/vat_info` once, threads ownCompanyVat through extraction and resolution, surfaces `self_match_blocked` in the response, and adds explanatory notes when the only VAT on the page was ours.
- **Currency silently defaulting to EUR for USD invoices** (closes #16) — Estonian-language OpenAI invoices print amounts as `40,00 $`. `RECEIPT_CURRENCY_PATTERNS` now matches `$` adjacent to digits as USD and `£` as GBP, in addition to the bare currency codes. `detectReceiptCurrency` returns `string | undefined` rather than silently falling back to "EUR" when no currency token can be bound to an amount line. `summarizeInvoiceExtraction` treats currency as a required field when `total_gross` is set, so missing-currency cases trigger the LLM-fallback recommendation.
- **Payment receipts double-booking as separate invoices** (closes #15) — Anthropic / Stripe-style payment confirmations (filename `Receipt-*.pdf`, "Receipt" header line, body containing "Date paid" / "Amount paid" / "Payment history" with a referenced invoice number) used to be classified as `purchase_invoice`. `process_receipt_batch` then queued them alongside the underlying invoice and would have created a duplicate on execute. `ReceiptClassification` gains a `payment_receipt` variant; the classifier requires both indicator phrases AND an invoice-number reference AND a structural signal (header or filename) before flagging the new class; `process_receipt_batch` routes payment receipts to `needs_review` with a note pointing at the underlying invoice number.
- **Supplier resolution misses corporate-form variants** — `LEGAL_SUFFIXES` in `company-name.ts` now strips `Corp`, `Corporation`, `Co`, `LP`, `LLP`, `PLC`, `PBC`, `PLLC`, `AG`, `SAS`, `SARL`, `SRL`, `SPA`, `NV`, and `BV` in addition to the existing Estonian / Baltic / German set. Dotted single-letter abbreviations (`N.V.`, `B.V.`, `S.A.`, `S.A.S.`, `S.r.l.`) are pre-collapsed to their bare-letter forms before suffix matching, so they reduce too. `resolveSupplierInternal` gains a `name_normalized` match tier that runs before the fuzzy fallback (with a ≥4-char floor and an ambiguity bail-out when multiple clients share the same normalized key): an invoice supplier "Anthropic, PBC" now resolves to an existing "Anthropic" client (the fuzzy 0.7 threshold rejected the pair at ≈0.6), so `suggestBookingInternal` reuses prior bookings instead of falling through to the keyword fallback. Note: the broader normalization is also used by `camt-import`, `bank-reconciliation`, `analyze-unconfirmed`, `wise-import`, and the `accounting-rules` auto-booking-rule lookup. User-defined rule keys keyed on the previous (narrower) normalized form may now match a wider set of counterparties; review your `accounting-rules.md` if you have rules that relied on the old behaviour.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- **README release callout** — updated the top-level README version note to describe the v0.12 guided workflow action UX, including `recommend_workflow`, `workflow_action_v1`, `recommended_next_action`, and approval previews.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Workflow recommendation tool** — `recommend_workflow` suggests the safest e-arveldaja workflow for a natural-language accounting goal, or lists common workflows when the goal is not yet known.
- **Guided workflow continuation** — `continue_accounting_workflow` reads a previous accounting inbox or workflow response and returns the next user-facing action: one question, one review item, one approval card, or one safe dry-run call.
- **Standard workflow action envelope** — workflow recommendation, accounting inbox, CAMT import, Wise import, receipt batch, and classification batch responses now include a `workflow_action_v1` block with `done`, `needs_decision`, `needs_review`, `recommended_next_action`, `available_actions`, and `approval_previews`.

## [0.11.8] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **User-facing workflows and Claude command docs** — package the setup, company overview, and Lightyear booking guides under both `workflows/` and `.claude/commands/` so MCP users can discover the intended flows from installed package files.

### Fixed
- **Product sale dimension creation** (closes #12) — `create_product` now exposes `cl_sale_accounts_dimensions_id` in the MCP input schema, forwards it to the products API, and documents that `list_account_dimensions` can be used to find valid dimension IDs.
- **MCP JSON and file-input hardening** — tightened JSON response handling, file validation coverage, and process-invoice syntax checks so malformed inputs fail predictably without losing useful diagnostics.

## [0.11.7] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Base64 oversize guard off-by-padding** — the pre-decode size check introduced in 0.11.6 over-counted decoded length by up to 2 bytes when the decoded byte count wasn't divisible by 3, because it ignored the trailing `=` padding characters. A remote client sending a valid payload of exactly `maxSize` got rejected before the post-decode check could approve it. The estimate now accounts for padding (`floor(length / 4) * 3 - padCount`) and is exact for well-formed base64. Caught by an independent Codex review pass; a regression test at the 50 MiB − 1 boundary locks the fix in.

## [0.11.6] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Base64 payload defence-in-depth** — `decodeBase64Strict` now rejects obviously-oversized inputs (~75% of the encoded length) before allocating the decoded buffer, so a multi-hundred-MB base64 payload can no longer force a full-size `Buffer.from` allocation before the post-decode size check would have caught it.
- **UTF-8 BOM tolerance for XML magic-byte sniff** — CAMT files that start with `0xEF 0xBB 0xBF<?xml` (some bank exports do) are now detected as `.xml` instead of requiring an explicit `base64:xml:<data>` hint.
- **`.jpg` / `.jpeg` variant matching** — the JPEG magic signature is marked as equivalent to both extensions. A caller who lists only `.jpeg` (or only `.jpg`) in its allow-list accepts base64 JPEG payloads either way, and the tmp file suffix matches the caller's vocabulary. Explicit `base64:jpeg:<data>` and `base64:jpg:<data>` hints are canonicalised before the spoof-conflict check.
- **Tests covering the new edges** — oversize pre-decode guard, UTF-8 BOM XML, `.jpeg`-only allow-list, `.jpg`/`.jpeg` hint-vs-magic canonicalisation, and idempotent cleanup.

### Changed
- **`server.json`** description tightened to 85 characters (was 81) to fit the registry's 100-character limit with more room for useful context: "Estonian e-arveldaja (RIK e-Financials) accounting — invoices, bank import, reports."
- **README** now has a short "Releasing to the MCP Registry" section pointing maintainers at the official `mcp-publisher` GitHub release (the snap package shipped by `habedi` ships an old CLI that rejects the current schema as "deprecated").

## [0.11.5] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **MCP Registry publication metadata** (towards #8) — `package.json` now exposes an `mcpName` property (`io.github.iseppo/e-arveldaja-mcp`) and a new top-level `server.json` describes the server for the Model Context Protocol Registry (repository, transport, environment variables). Once this version is published to npm and `mcp-publisher publish` is run against the project, the server becomes discoverable in the registry so clients like Claude Cowork (which only loads registry-listed servers) can connect without the `claude mcp add` CLI step. Registry submission itself still requires a maintainer to run `mcp-publisher login github` + `mcp-publisher publish`.

## [0.11.4] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Cross-system file transfer via base64** (closes #9) — every file-reading tool now accepts an inline base64 payload as its `file_path` parameter in addition to a regular local path. Remote MCP clients (Claude desktop, Cowork, Cursor on another host, etc.) that cannot expose their local filesystem to the server can now pass the file contents directly, unblocking `extract_pdf_invoice`, `create_purchase_invoice_from_pdf`, `upload_invoice_document`, `import_camt053`, `parse_camt053`, `import_wise_transactions`, `parse_lightyear_statement`, `parse_lightyear_capital_gains`, `book_lightyear_trades`, `book_lightyear_distributions`, and `lightyear_portfolio_summary`. Syntax:
  - `base64:<b64data>` — magic-byte detection for PDF / PNG / JPEG / CAMT XML
  - `base64:<ext>:<b64data>` — explicit extension hint (required for CSV and any format without a reliable magic-byte signature). Example: `base64:csv:QSxCLEMK...`.
- **`resolveFileInput` helper in `file-validation.ts`** — single entry point that validates either a local path (delegating to `validateFilePath`) or decodes a base64 payload, materialises it to a per-call tmp file (mode `0600`), and returns `{ path, cleanup }`. Size limit is enforced before writing to disk and hint/magic-byte conflicts are rejected to block extension spoofing. Callers run the existing logic against `path` and invoke `cleanup()` in a `finally` block so the tmp file is removed after use.
- **Tests** — 8 new cases in `src/file-validation.test.ts` cover path pass-through, magic-byte detection for PDF, explicit-extension CSV, missing extension rejection, disallowed extension rejection, oversize rejection, malformed base64 rejection, and hint/content mismatch rejection.

### Added
- **OCR trust boundary on tool output** — new `wrapUntrustedOcr` helper applies per-call nonce delimiters (`<<UNTRUSTED_OCR_START:{nonce}>>` / `<<UNTRUSTED_OCR_END:{nonce}>>`) to `raw_text` returned by `extract_pdf_invoice` and `process_receipt_batch`, plus `description` in receipt-batch results. Prevents a malicious scanned receipt from smuggling instructions into the downstream LLM via a fixed, guessable delimiter.
- **`vat_explicit` flag on extracted receipt fields** — `extractAmounts` now reports whether `total_vat` came from an explicit OCR VAT / net label or a structural fallback, so downstream auto-booking can tell "real zero" apart from "derived zero".
- **Regression tests** — `extractAmounts("Kokku 100 EUR KM 20%")` no longer collapses the gross total to `total_vat`; `resolveSupplierFromTransaction` returns `found: false` without creating a placeholder supplier when the transaction has no counterparty signal; `wrapUntrustedOcr` delimiter spoofing cannot escape the sandbox.

### Fixed
- **Lightyear FX drift on non-EUR cash-equivalent sells** — `book_lightyear_trades` used to book USD-denominated cash-sweep sells (e.g. `ICSUSSDP`) at 1:1 EUR proceeds against cost basis, leaving permanent FX drift on the investment account. Non-EUR cash-equivalent sells without capital gains data are now skipped with a clear reason; EUR sweeps (e.g. `BRICEKSP`) still book 1:1 as before.
- **VAT mis-extraction from embedded percent rates** — a line like `"Kokku 100 EUR KM 20%"` previously assigned the gross total (100) as VAT because the percent-rate filter left only the gross as the last VAT candidate. The pickedVat path now drops that fallback so `total_vat` stays undefined for the later gross − net reconciliation.
- **Silent VAT stripping on derived zero** — auto-booking used to set `vat_rate_dropdown = "-"` whenever `total_vat === 0`, including structurally derived zeros. It now requires `vat_explicit` so only OCR-stated zero invoices strip VAT.
- **Bogus `"Transaction <id>"` suppliers** — `resolveSupplierFromTransaction` now early-returns when both `bank_account_name` and `description` are null, instead of creating a placeholder client name.
- **Lightyear legacy duplicate detection** — journals with raw `OR-`/`CN-`/`DT-`/etc. document numbers (pre `LY:` prefix) are now recognised as duplicates alongside the current `LY:{ref}` format.
- **Lightyear FX fee fallback** — when the EUR side of a conversion reports zero fee, the FX fee is now derived from the foreign side using the available rate instead of silently rounding to 0.
- **Dead inter-trade fields removed** — `TradeExtractionResult` no longer returns `tradeRowIndexes` / `consumedConversionRowIndexes`; the caller uses `trade.conversion_row_indexes` directly, collapsing an O(trades × rows) lookup to O(trades).

### Changed
- **`book-invoice` workflow prompt** — `get_vat_info` is now the first step so VAT treatment decisions reflect the current VAT-registration status. Subsequent steps renumbered and the VAT-treatment step references step 1.
- **Inline-confirmation rail coverage** — `receipt-batch`, `import-camt`, `import-wise`, and `classify-unmatched` prompts now append `INLINE_CONFIRMATION_RAIL`, and the rail itself is split into explicit PROJECT/unregistered-journal inline handling vs `needs_review` (accountant judgment) handling via `resolve_accounting_review_item` / `prepare_accounting_review_action`.
- **`reconcile-bank` prompt** — `min_confidence` tiers (0 include-all, 30 noise floor, 80 high-confidence) documented at both call sites instead of left as magic numbers.
- **`new-supplier` prompt** — former steps 3 and 5 merged so `resolve_supplier` is not called twice; downstream steps renumbered.
- **`lightyear-booking` prompt** — first parse step no longer sets `include_rows: true`; the summary view is enough for the overview and row-level inspection is only done on demand.
- **`skip_tickers` semantics in `book_lightyear_trades`** — empty string is now treated as the default skip list; the literal value `"none"` disables the filter. `describe` text updated accordingly.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Prompt and workflow alignment** — synced prompt surfaces, shipped workflow markdown, and command docs with the current tool behavior for CAMT duplicate handling, setup credentials, month-end input requirements, reconcile-bank wording, and purchase-invoice VAT dimension fields.
- **Account validation coverage** — account preflight checks now validate account existence and active status alongside dimension requirements across journal creation, transaction confirmation, sale invoice creation, purchase invoice creation, and purchase-invoice-from-PDF flows.
- **Transaction confirm safety** — `confirm_transaction` now completes distribution parsing and account validation before applying a temporary `clients_id`, preventing partial mutation on pre-confirm validation failures.
- **Transaction metadata update scope** — `update_transaction` is now restricted to safe CAMT-enrichment metadata fields (`bank_ref_number`, counterparty name/account details, description, reference) instead of accepting arbitrary transaction patches.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **CAMT duplicate cleanup partial failure** — if the delete step throws after the keep-transaction was already patched, the response now returns `partial: true` with an error message and a `DELETE_FAILED` audit entry so the trail is complete and the gap is actionable.
- **Autopilot re-recommends failed steps** — `next_recommended_action` no longer suggests a step that already ran and failed; the exclusion set now covers all executed steps regardless of status.
- **Autopilot re-recommends skipped steps** — `next_recommended_action` now also treats skipped steps as handled, so `classify_unmatched_transactions` is no longer re-suggested while materialization is still pending.
- **Patch field structured values** — `extractTransactionPatchFields` now keeps numeric and bigint values (coerced to strings) but drops objects/arrays instead of turning them into `"[object Object]"` junk.
- **Rule prefill from heuristic suggestions** — `save_auto_booking_rule` is no longer pre-filled from generic keyword-match suggestions; only `supplier_history` and `local_rules` sources (where the booking target was already trusted) seed the rule fields. Heuristic suggestions still surface `save_auto_booking_rule` in the suggested tools list without a prefilled `proposed_action`.
- **Rule booking field whitelist clarity** — `extractSuggestedRuleFields` renamed to `extractRuleBookingFields`; comment documents why `match`/`category` are intentionally absent from the whitelist. Type guards added for all fields (number vs string) so malformed values are dropped cleanly.
- **Uncapped existing-IDs label** — CAMT duplicate follow-up summary now shows at most 5 existing transaction IDs, appending `, +N more` when over 5.
- **Ambiguous materialization skip reason** — `classify_unmatched_transactions` skip summary now distinguishes `pending_materialization` (import ran and has work to apply) from `earlier_step_failed` (import was skipped or threw), giving a more actionable message in each case.
- **VAT hint missing in review-only suggestion** — when a metadata-only auto-booking rule exists (has `vat_rate_dropdown`/`reversed_vat_id` but no article/account), those fields are now threaded through to the keyword-match suggestion so reviewers see the reverse-charge hint even in review-only mode.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Accounting inbox autopilot** — new `run_accounting_inbox_dry_runs` tool scans a workspace, automatically executes safe dry-run steps (CAMT parse, Wise preview, receipt scan), and returns one consolidated preview. Designed as a non-accountant-friendly first pass that requires no manual tool sequencing.
- **Accounting review resolver** — new `resolve_accounting_review_item` tool turns review items (CAMT duplicates, classification groups, unmatched transactions) into concrete next-step plans with default handling, unresolved questions, compliance basis (RPS/RTJ references), and the safest follow-up tool.
- **Accounting review action preparation** — new `prepare_accounting_review_action` tool converts resolved review items into ready-to-approve tool calls (e.g. delete duplicate, save booking rule, confirm transaction).
- **CAMT duplicate cleanup** — new `cleanup_camt_possible_duplicate` tool enriches missing CAMT metadata onto the kept older transaction and deletes the newly imported duplicate.
- **Auto-booking rules** — new `save_auto_booking_rule` tool saves stable counterparty booking defaults to `accounting-rules.md` after approval, so repeat transactions from the same supplier are booked consistently.
- **Review workflow prompts** — new `resolve-accounting-review` and `prepare-accounting-review-action` prompts guide multi-step review resolution with standards-aware compliance references.

### Fixed
- **Accounting rule merge** — fixed edge cases where rule overrides from `accounting-rules.md` could clobber confirmed supplier history or produce incomplete booking defaults.
- **CAMT duplicate handling** — when multiple confirmed transactions match a CAMT row, the resolver now asks which is authoritative instead of silently picking the first match.
- **list_accounts token overflow** — response now returns only essential fields (id, balance_type, name_est, account_type_est, etc.), roughly halving the response size so it stays within Claude Code's context limit.
- **Accounting inbox defaults** — improved default bank account dimension selection and receipt matching suggestions.
- **Wise prompt guidance** — tightened CAMT duplicate and Wise import prompt wording to reduce false-positive duplicate warnings.
- **Prompt field name drift** — `setup-credentials` prompt referenced camelCase fields (`envFile`, `storageScope`) but `import_apikey_credentials` returns snake_case (`env_file`, `storage_scope`). All field names now match the tool response.
- **Month-end missing documents** — prompt now mentions transactions alongside purchase invoices and journal entries, matching what `find_missing_documents` actually returns.
- **Credential precedence in CLAUDE.md** — corrected to match actual `config.ts` load order: `EARVELDAJA_API_KEY_FILE` first, then env vars, `.env` files, `apikey*.txt` last.

### Changed
- **109 tools** (was 103), **15 workflow prompts** (was 12), **12 resources**.
- **Accounting inbox** now supports an autopilot mode that chains dry-run steps automatically, review items that need accountant decisions, and one-click resolution of common patterns (duplicate cleanup, rule saving).

## [0.10.3] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Markdown accounting rules reload** — `accounting-rules.md` is now reloaded when the file changes, so corrected or updated company rules take effect without restarting the server.
- **Owner expense VAT defaults** — markdown rules can now define partial VAT-deduction defaults with a ratio, and stable company policy can be reused without re-answering the same question every time.
- **Receipt inbox VAT preservation** — supplier-history VAT metadata is now preserved when OCR misses an invoice VAT total, avoiding accidental loss of reverse-charge or prior confirmed VAT treatment.
- **User guidance cleanup** — accounting override messages now consistently point to `accounting-rules.md`, and documented examples in the template are no longer misread as active rules.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-30

### Security
- **XXE defense-in-depth** — CAMT XML parser now rejects files containing `<!DOCTYPE` or `<!ENTITY` declarations before parsing, preventing potential XXE attacks even if `processEntities` is bypassed in a future parser update.
- **Audit log path traversal prevention** — `sanitizeAuditLogName` now strips `..` sequences from company-name-derived filenames, preventing writes outside the `logs/` directory.
- **npm audit clean** — fixed transitive ReDoS vulnerabilities in `path-to-regexp` and `picomatch`.
- **Audit log file permissions** — `clearAuditLog` now writes with mode `0o600` via the shared `writePrivateTextFile` helper.

### Added
- **Shared company name normalizer** (`src/company-name.ts`) — unified three divergent implementations (bank-reconciliation, wise-import, receipt-extraction) into a single function with comprehensive international legal suffix list (`ou`, `as`, `mtu`, `llc`, `ltd`, `gmbh`, `oy`, etc.) and NFKD normalization. Optional `stripNonAlphanumeric` mode for grouping/deduplication.
- **Centralized account defaults** (`src/accounting-defaults.ts`) — named constants for standard Estonian chart-of-accounts numbers (`DEFAULT_LIABILITY_ACCOUNT`, `DEFAULT_VAT_ACCOUNT`, `CURRENT_YEAR_PROFIT_ACCOUNT`, etc.), replacing magic numbers across 6+ files.
- **Shared test fixtures** (`src/__fixtures__/accounting.ts`) — `makeAccount`, `makePosting`, `makeJournal`, `makeTransaction`, `makeBankAccount` factory functions, eliminating duplicate fixture builders across test files.
- **158 new unit tests** — `inter-account-utils.test.ts` (26 tests), `receipt-extraction.test.ts` (80 tests), `transaction-status.test.ts` (8 tests), `invoice-extraction-fallback.test.ts` (41 tests), plus additional security tests for XXE and path traversal.

### Fixed
- **Unsafe type cast in `buildInterAccountJournalIndex`** — replaced `as number` cast with null guard to prevent potential `NaN` keys in the journal index map.
- **Unsafe `(err as any).invoiceId`** — replaced with typed `InvoiceCreationError` class in `purchase-invoices.api.ts`.
- **Runtime type validation on JSON parse helpers** — `requireNumericFields` now validates that `amount`, `accounts_id`, `total_net_price`, and other critical numeric fields are actual numbers (not strings), catching malformed LLM-generated JSON at the trust boundary.
- **CSV size limit mismatch** — `parseCSV` now accepts a caller-specified `maxSize` parameter. Wise import passes 10MB to match its file-read limit, preventing confusing errors on large CSV files.
- **Unnecessary re-export removed** — `analyze-unconfirmed.ts` now imports `normalizeCompanyName` directly from `company-name.ts` instead of through `bank-reconciliation.ts`.

### Changed
- **664 unit tests** across 44 test files (was 442 across 38).

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **Purchase invoice VAT rounding** — `createAndSetTotals` now auto-adjusts `project_no_vat_gross_price` on the last item when explicit `vat_price` differs from API-computed item VAT by a rounding cent (e.g. 9% on 9.16 → 0.82 vs invoice's 0.83). Previously this caused "Invoice rows net sum and VAT does not match invoice gross sum" and required manually splitting items.
- **Purchase invoice PATCH preserves `cl_fringe_benefits_id`** — `createAndSetTotals` now sends original items (with all required fields) back in the PATCH instead of API-returned items that lacked `cl_fringe_benefits_id`, preventing NOT NULL constraint errors.
- **String-typed numbers in JSON coerced** — `requireNumericFields` now auto-coerces valid numeric strings to numbers before validation (e.g. `related_id: "102011324307"` → `102011324307`), matching the `z.coerce` behavior on top-level ID parameters. LLMs often quote numbers in JSON string arguments.

### Added
- **`clients_id` parameter on `confirm_transaction`** — CAMT-imported transactions often lack `clients_id`, causing "buyer or supplier is missing" when confirming against accounts (not invoices). The new optional parameter sets the client on the transaction before confirming, avoiding the workaround of recreating the transaction manually.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-29

**Major update.** Large parts of the codebase have been rewritten — credential management, bank reconciliation, audit logging, and batch workflows all received significant changes. **You may need to re-add your API credentials** after updating, as the credential storage system has been redesigned.

### Breaking Changes
- **Credential storage redesigned** — credentials are now stored in `.env` files (local or global config directory) instead of being read directly from `apikey*.txt` at startup. Existing `apikey*.txt` files are detected and can be imported via the new `import_apikey_credentials` tool or the `setup-credentials` workflow prompt. After import, the `.env` file becomes the canonical credential store.
- **Parent directory scanning removed** — the server no longer searches parent directories for `apikey*.txt` files. Only the working directory is scanned.
- **Global config directory** — credentials can now be stored in a platform-native global config directory (`~/.config/e-arveldaja-mcp` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/e-arveldaja-mcp` on macOS, `%APPDATA%/e-arveldaja-mcp` on Windows). Override with `EARVELDAJA_CONFIG_DIR`. This lets the server find credentials regardless of which directory you launch it from.

### Added
- **Credential import workflow** — new `import_apikey_credentials` tool verifies API credentials against the live server and saves them to a `.env` file (local or global). Startup auto-detects `apikey*.txt` files and offers to import them via the `setup-credentials` prompt.
- **Stored credential management** — `list_stored_credentials` shows all saved `.env` credential sets. `remove_stored_credentials` removes a stored credential by index.
- **Setup credentials prompt** — new `setup-credentials` workflow prompt guides through credential verification and storage.
- **`.env` value quoting** — `serializeEnvFile` now quotes values containing special characters (`#`, `$`, `\`, `` ` ``, `"`, newlines) and escapes them properly, preventing credential corruption on re-read.
- **Invoice index for O(1) matching** — `reconcile_transactions` and `auto_confirm_exact_matches` now build index maps by ref_number and amount for fast candidate narrowing instead of O(n*m) full scans.
- **Multi-currency matching fallback** — `matchScore` computes `base_gross_price` from `gross_price * currency_rate` when the base price field is absent, fixing false-negative matches on foreign-currency purchase invoices.
- **ClientsApi aggregate cache** — `findByName` and `findByCode` now use a 120s TTL cached `listAll()`, avoiding redundant pagination on repeated lookups.
- **`EARVELDAJA_TAG_NOTES` option** — set to `true` to append `(e-arveldaja-mcp)` to the notes field of all invoices created by the server.
- **Standardized batch execution contracts** — all batch tools now use a consistent `DRY_RUN`/`EXECUTED` mode pattern with typed result/skipped/error arrays and audit references.

### Fixed
- **Credential source precedence** — `EARVELDAJA_API_KEY_FILE` now takes priority over env vars and `.env` files. Incomplete credential sets in one `.env` no longer block a complete set in another. Standalone `EARVELDAJA_SERVER` in a local `.env` no longer overrides the server setting from a complete credential file.
- **FX transfer reconciliation** — fixed multiple edge cases in foreign currency inter-account transfers, CAMT split imports, and Wise import FX handling.
- **Inter-account transfer pairing** — refined target inference, dedupe rules, and blocking logic for CAMT-imported inter-account transfers. Unified invoice direction rules across all bank matching tools.
- **Annual report liability classification** — tightened account classification for balance sheet reporting.
- **Supplier fuzzy match hardened** — raised Levenshtein similarity threshold from 0.5 to 0.7 and added minimum name length of 4 characters to prevent false-positive matches on short company names.
- **Journal ID null guard** — `buildInterAccountJournalIndex` now checks `j.id == null` before use instead of relying on a non-null assertion.
- **Connection-scoped VAT warnings** — fallback warning dedup keys are now scoped per connection, preventing one connection's warnings from suppressing another's.
- **Runtime input validation** — all optional numeric fields in `parsePostings`, `parseSaleInvoiceItems`, and `parsePurchaseInvoiceItems` are now type-checked at the trust boundary, catching string-as-number bugs from LLM-generated JSON.
- **Cross-platform invoice file handling** — fixed file path handling for invoice documents across different platforms.
- **Audit log label resolution** — company-based labels, refreshed on raw log lookup, with proper permission hardening.
- **MCP error handling** — fixed prompt workflow drift and error propagation in edge cases.

### Changed
- **96 tools** (was 93), **11 workflow prompts** (was 10), **15 resources** (was 12).
- **Audit log labels** — now company-specific with bilingual label resolution and improved metadata.
- **Claude command prompts** — normalized to match workflow definitions.
- **663 unit tests** covering all changes.

## [0.9.12] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Security: `isSecureEnvFile` fail-closed** — catch block now only returns `true` for ENOENT (file not found). Previously any `lstatSync` error was silently treated as safe.
- **Security: stack traces gated behind debug mode** — fatal error handler no longer writes `err.stack` to stderr unless `EARVELDAJA_DEBUG=true`.
- **Security: audit log permissions** — log directory created with mode `0700`, files with mode `0600` to prevent other users reading financial data.
- **Rounding consistency** — trial balance totals, `sumCategory`, client debt totals, aging analysis bucket/debtor/creditor accumulators, and overdue receivables/payables totals now use `roundMoney()` at each accumulation step, matching the pattern already used in `computeAllBalances`.
- **Inter-account duplicate detection** — replaced `Math.round(x*100)/100` with `roundMoney()` in journal key generation (`inter-account-utils.ts`, `bank-reconciliation.ts`), fixing potential false negatives at X.XX5 boundaries.
- **Dividend `grossDividend`** — now rounded before use in journal posting amounts.
- **Rate limiter race condition** — `waitForRateLimitTurn()` uses `.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)` so concurrent callers chain correctly instead of potentially bypassing the 100ms spacing.
- **Wise CSV import** — malformed numeric values now throw instead of silently defaulting to 0. Exchange rate no longer silently defaults to 1 on parse failure. Required header validation expanded from 4 to 6 columns.
- **CSV BOM stripping** — `parseCSV()` now strips UTF-8 BOM (`\uFEFF`), fixing header matching issues with Windows/Excel exports.
- **VAT rate comma replacement** — `normalizeVatRate()` uses regex `/,/g` for global replacement instead of string `.replace()` which only replaced the first comma.
- **`toMcpJson` error handling** — circular reference serialization now throws a descriptive error instead of an opaque `TypeError`.
- **Readonly pagination** — `readonlyCachedGetAll` now updates `totalPages` from each subsequent response, matching `BaseResource.listAll()` behavior.

### Added
- **Account dimension validation** — `create_purchase_invoice` and `create_purchase_invoice_from_pdf` now validate that items targeting accounts with dimensions include `purchase_accounts_dimensions_id`. When the account has exactly one dimension, it is auto-filled. When there are multiple, the error lists all available dimension IDs.

- **ID parameter coercion** — all 22 ID parameters across all tools now use `z.coerce.number().int().positive()`, automatically converting string-typed numbers (e.g. `"5060945"` → `5060945`) while still rejecting invalid values. Prevents LLM tool-calling failures when IDs are passed as strings.

### Changed
- **Aging report field rename** — `total_unpaid` renamed to `total_unpaid_face_value` to clarify that partially-paid invoices are shown at full invoice amount. Warning message updated.
- **Owner expense `vat_rate` validation** — values > 1 are rejected with a clear error ("looks like a percentage, pass a decimal fraction instead").
- **Purchase invoice tool descriptions** — `create_purchase_invoice` and `create_purchase_invoice_from_pdf` now document `purchase_accounts_dimensions_id` (required for accounts with sub-accounts). `suggest_purchase_booking` output includes the dimension ID from historical invoices.
- **Book-invoice prompt/workflow/command** — all three now reference `purchase_accounts_dimensions_id` in the booking suggestion and invoice creation steps.
- **CLAUDE.md** — documented the account dimensions requirement under "Purchase invoice creation".

## [0.9.11] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Prompt field name mismatches** — import-camt prompt and workflow now reference correct field names (`skipped_count`, `error_count`, `sample`, `skipped_summary`). Import-wise prompt now correctly describes `created`/`skipped` as counts and `results`/`skipped_details` as the arrays.
- **Reconcile-bank workflow** — added missing inter-account transfers step with `reconcile_inter_account_transfers` dry-run/execute flow and duplicate journal warning.

## [0.9.10] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **TOON format** — all MCP tool and resource responses now use Token-Oriented Object Notation (TOON) instead of JSON. TOON achieves 30-60% fewer tokens with indentation-based structure, CSV-style tabular arrays, and minimal quoting. Lossless — fully roundtrippable to JSON.
- **`@toon-format/toon` dependency** for encoding/decoding.

### Changed
- **Null field stripping** — `toMcpJson()` removes all null/undefined fields before encoding, reducing response noise across all 85+ tool call sites.
- **Default value omission** — `duplicate: false`, `duplicate_transaction_ids: []`, `partially_paid_warning: false`, `distribution_ready` removed from responses when at default values.
- **CAMT import results compacted** — returns summary + sample (first 10) instead of full arrays. Skipped duplicates grouped into `skipped_summary`.
- **Wise import results compacted** — skipped entries grouped by reason with count and sample IDs. Descriptions stripped from created entries.
- **Reconciliation results compacted** — `other_candidates` replaced with `other_candidate_count`. Transaction `type` field removed (always "C").
- **Static guidance moved to tool descriptions** — `extract_pdf_invoice` instructions string and UTC date warnings no longer in response bodies.
- **Resource mimeType** — changed from `application/json` to `text/plain` to match TOON content.
- **Prompts updated** — 5 prompts and 2 markdown workflow files updated for changed response field names (`distribution_ready` → `distribution` key presence, `skipped_duplicate_details` → `skipped_summary`).

## [0.9.9] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Token optimization for list responses** — all 14 `list_*` tools now use compact JSON (no pretty-printing), saving ~40% tokens on large paginated results.
- **`list_journals` strips postings** — journal list responses no longer include the `postings` array. Use `get_journal` for full details with postings.
- **`parse_lightyear_statement` summary mode** — returns summary only by default (trade counts, totals by ticker). Set `include_rows=true` for individual trade details as compact markdown tables instead of JSON arrays.
- **`parse_lightyear_statement` date filters** — new `date_from`/`date_to` parameters to filter entries before processing, avoiding token overflow on large CSV files.

### Fixed
- **Config tests** — updated to use `process.chdir()` instead of mocking `getProjectRoot()`, matching the cwd-based credential search from 0.9.8.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **API key search location** — `apikey*.txt` and `.env` files are now scanned from the working directory (`cwd`) instead of the npm package root. This means `npx` users place credentials in the directory where they launch their AI assistant, not inside `node_modules`.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Session audit log** — every mutating MCP operation now logs a detailed Markdown entry to `logs/{connection}.audit.md` in the working directory. Includes timestamps, tool name, entity details, account postings (D/K), financial amounts, and file uploads. Persists across sessions, one file per company/connection.
- **`get_session_log` tool** — view the audit log with filters (entity_type, action, date_from, date_to, limit). Supports `connection` parameter to view other companies' logs.
- **`list_audit_logs` tool** — list all available audit log files with entry counts and last entry dates.
- **`clear_session_log` tool** — reset the current connection's audit log.
- **Bilingual audit labels** — Estonian by default, set `EARVELDAJA_AUDIT_LANG=en` for English.
- **66 logAudit calls** across 12 tool files covering all mutating operations: CRUD, imports (CAMT, Wise, Lightyear), batch processing, reconciliation, tax operations, and recurring invoices.

### Fixed
- **Audit log security** — user-controlled values (client names, descriptions, invoice numbers) are escaped to prevent Markdown injection. File names are sanitized (no path traversal). Rollback/error-recovery operations are intentionally excluded from the log.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **MCP SDK version** — reverted exact pin `1.12.1` to `^1.12.1` and updated to 1.27.1. The exact pin broke the build because `registerResource`, `registerPrompt`, and `sendLoggingMessage` types were only added in later SDK versions.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **CAMT import cleanup** — removed dead `byRefNumber` and `descriptions` structures from duplicate lookup that were no longer consumed after the overmatch fix in 0.9.4
- **HTTP retry test** — fixed unhandled promise rejection that caused CI exit code 1 despite all tests passing

### Changed
- **README** — updated Lightyear section to mention dividends/distributions/cash interest, corrected file access scope from "home directory" to "working directory", added Node.js 18+ requirement

## [0.9.4] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Lightyear Dividend/Interest support** — `book_lightyear_distributions` now imports Dividend and Interest entries from the account statement CSV alongside existing Distribution entries. Cash interest entries (no ticker) get a dedicated journal title.
- **Cash flow: full working capital coverage** — indirect cash flow statement now includes 13xx (short-term investments), 14xx (other receivables), 20xx/21xx (short-term liabilities), and 29xx (accrued liabilities) in operating adjustments.
- **HTTP retry for all methods** — network errors (timeout, connection reset) now trigger retries for PATCH/POST/DELETE, not just GET. Confirmations and registrations are idempotent and benefit from retry on flaky connections.
- **Balance sheet: 13xx/14xx accounts** — current assets now includes short-term financial investments (13xx) and other short-term receivables (14xx).
- **Pagination timeout** — `listAll()` enforces a 5-minute overall timeout to prevent indefinite hangs.
- **Node.js engine requirement** — `package.json` now declares `engines.node >= 18.0.0`.

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: parseAmount thousands separator** — `"1.000"` (European thousands format) was parsed as 1.00 instead of 1000, producing invoices with 1000x wrong amounts. Now correctly detects single-dot thousands separator pattern.
- **CRITICAL: CAMT duplicate detection overmatch** — bank_reference was incorrectly looked up in the ref_number map (cross-field), and description substring matching could silently discard legitimate transactions. Removed both overmatch paths; duplicate detection now uses only the correct `bank_reference` field.
- **Lightyear sell journal balance** — gain/loss is now derived as `proceeds - costBasis` instead of using independently rounded CSV columns, ensuring the journal entry always balances.
- **Lightyear distribution credit rounding** — added missing `roundMoney()` on distribution income credit amount to prevent IEEE 754 drift.
- **Wise inter-account key rounding** — replaced `Math.round(x*100)/100` with `roundMoney()` to prevent potential duplicate journal entries on specific float values.
- **FX invoice bank-link amount** — receipt inbox now uses `base_gross_price` instead of transaction amount for distribution, preventing partial/over payment on foreign currency invoices.
- **Inter-account partial confirmation** — if incoming transaction confirmation fails after outgoing is confirmed, the outgoing is now automatically invalidated instead of leaving books in an inconsistent state.
- **Supplier fuzzy match false positives** — added Levenshtein distance ratio gate (≥ 0.5) to prevent short names (e.g. "LHV") from matching wrong clients.
- **PDF VAT double-rounding** — per-item VAT is now accumulated unrounded; `roundMoney()` applied only on the final total.
- **Receipt batch double-failure** — DRAFT invoices from failed rollbacks are no longer pushed into batch context, allowing re-processing on next run.
- **Transaction rollback error surfacing** — when `clients_id` rollback fails after a failed confirmation, the error is now included in the thrown exception so callers know the transaction may be in an inconsistent state.
- **Purchase invoice partial-create error** — `invoiceId` is now attached as a structured field on the error object for programmatic recovery.
- **Wise fee assertion** — replaced fragile `!` non-null assertion on `feeAccountDimensionsId` with explicit runtime check.
- **Lightyear ambiguous gains detection** — exact-duplicate capital gains rows (same date+ticker+qty+proceeds) are now counted in the ambiguity warning.
- **roundMoney(Infinity)** — now throws instead of silently returning 0, surfacing upstream division-by-zero bugs.
- **Cache key stability** — `list()` cache keys now use sorted params, preventing silent cache misses from parameter order variation.
- **Registry API response limit** — 64KB response size cap on `ariregister.rik.ee` fetch to prevent OOM from oversized/hijacked responses.

### Changed
- **Source maps enabled** — `tsconfig.json` now enables `sourceMap` and `declarationMap` for debuggable production builds.
- **MCP SDK pinned** — `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` pinned to exact `1.12.1` (removed `^`).
- **Sale invoice API rename** — `saleInvoices.getDocument()` renamed to `saleInvoices.getSystemPdf()` to accurately reflect the endpoint (`/pdf_system`).
- **Debug stack traces gated** — tool handler stack traces now require `EARVELDAJA_DEBUG=true` instead of writing unconditionally to stderr.
- **HTTP error truncation** — API error messages truncated to 500 chars to limit information leakage.
- **Fatal error stack trace** — startup fatal errors now include the full stack trace in stderr output.

### Removed
- **Dead code cleanup** — removed 14 unused methods across API files (`merge`, `findByVatNo`, `findByName`/`findByCode` on products, document operations on journals/transactions/sale-invoices), dead `loadConfig()`, dead `summarizeIdentifierHintFallback()`, dead `EXPECTED_HEADERS` constant, and 25-line re-export barrel in receipt-inbox.
- **Duplicate code consolidated** — extracted `buildBankAccountLookups()` (was duplicated verbatim in 2 files), `effectiveGross()` helper (replaced 12 inline copies), and reused `computeAccountBalance()` (deleted duplicate `computeRetainedEarningsBalance()`).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- **File access roots tightened** — file-reading tools now default to the working directory (and its subdirectories) + `/tmp`. Previously the default was the entire home directory. Set `EARVELDAJA_ALLOW_HOME=true` to restore the old behavior, or use `EARVELDAJA_ALLOWED_PATHS` for a custom allowlist.

### Fixed
- **`.env` symlink/permission blocking** — insecure `.env` files (symlinked or group/other-readable) are now skipped entirely, not just warned about. Matches the security posture of `apikey*.txt` validation.
- **Company name normalization** — strips Estonian legal suffixes (AS, OÜ, MTÜ, SA, TÜ) for better bank reconciliation matching
- **Upload filename sanitization** — special characters stripped, capped at 255 chars to prevent stored XSS on upstream UI
- **Intermediate rounding in balance computation** — `roundMoney()` applied on each accumulation step in account balances, financial statements, and retained earnings to prevent IEEE 754 drift
- **Short name false-positive matching** — company name substring matching now requires both strings >= 4 chars
- **Dividend dry_run** — `prepare_dividend_package` now supports `dry_run` parameter for previewing without creating journal entries
- **Expense debit rounding** — `owner_expense_reimbursement` now rounds `net_amount` for VAT-registered case
- **Resource ID validation** — dynamic MCP resources reject non-integer/negative IDs instead of passing `NaN` to API
- **Readonly API error message** — no longer leaks raw API response shape
- **Capital gains match warning** — accurately says "picked first match" instead of misleading "tiebreaker"
- **FX date extraction** — handles both space and `T` separators in Lightyear CSV dates
- **HTTP 204 response** — returns minimal `ApiResponse` instead of unsafe `undefined as T` cast
- **Dead code cleanup** — removed unreachable `|| 0` in `roundMoney` large-magnitude bypass
- **Comment accuracy** — journal batch comment says "parallel" not "sequential"
- **CLAUDE.md** — cache invalidation documentation now matches actual (post-mutation) behavior

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Auto-upload source document** — `create_purchase_invoice_from_pdf` now automatically uploads the source PDF/image to the created purchase invoice, eliminating the separate `upload_purchase_invoice_document` step
- **VOID transaction handling** — CAMT import, Wise import, receipt inbox, and analyze-unconfirmed tools now exclude VOID (invalidated) transactions from matching, duplicate detection, and reconciliation
- **Transaction confirm rollback** — if transaction confirmation fails after auto-setting `clients_id`, the change is now rolled back (best-effort with stderr logging on rollback failure)
- **`.env` file permission checks** — startup now warns about symlinked or group/other-readable `.env` files, matching the security posture of `apikey*.txt` validation

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Cache invalidation race condition** — all mutating API methods (create, update, delete, confirm, invalidate, upload/delete document) across 8 API files now invalidate cache *after* the API call succeeds, not before. Eliminates a window where concurrent reads could cache stale data for up to 300 seconds.
- **Purchase invoice tolerance** — `confirmWithTotals` now uses exact `roundMoney()` comparison instead of a 0.02 EUR tolerance that could silently accept accounting discrepancies. Also fixed falsy `!currentGross` check that treated zero-value invoices (credit notes) as needing repair.
- **Stack trace leakage** — error stack traces are now written to stderr only, no longer sent through the MCP logging protocol where they could expose internal paths to the AI model
- **Error message sanitization** — removed `inspect()` fallback in `toolError()` that could leak internal object structure; non-serializable errors now return `"Internal error"`
- **`roundMoney(NaN)` silent corruption** — now throws instead of silently returning `0`, surfacing upstream bugs immediately in a financial context
- **`roundToDecimals` IEEE 754 edge case** — receipt extraction now uses the same string-exponent rounding as `roundMoney()`, avoiding `.toFixed()` boundary errors
- **Unparseable VAT rates silently skipped** — `normalizeItemsForNonVat` now logs a warning when `vat_rate_dropdown` produces `NaN`
- **Journal batch fetch null id** — `listAllWithPostings` now guards against journals with `id == null` before attempting individual fetch
- **`sumCategory` floating-point drift** — return value now wrapped in `roundMoney()` for defense-in-depth
- **`parseInt` without radix** — all 3 call sites now pass explicit radix 10
- **Cache iterator fragility** — `invalidate()` now collects keys first, then deletes in a second pass (safe against future refactors)
- **CSV size limit** — `parseCSV` now enforces a 1 MB size limit, consistent with `safeJsonParse`
- **Project root silent fallback** — `getProjectRoot()` now logs a warning when falling back to `process.cwd()`
- **`invalidateReadonlyCache` accidental full clear** — `pattern` parameter is now required, preventing callers from accidentally clearing all reference data caches
- **Receipt inbox VOID rollback** — receipt batch processing now correctly handles VOID transactions during rollback and skips them during bank matching

### Changed
- **Prompts and commands updated** for the auto-upload workflow in `create_purchase_invoice_from_pdf`
- **410 tests** total (up from 396 in 0.9.1)

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **`analyze_unconfirmed_transactions` tool** — read-only tool that categorizes unconfirmed bank transactions into actionable suggestions: likely duplicate (with confidence scoring), confirm against invoice, confirm as inter-account transfer, confirm as expense, or manual review. Includes ready-to-use distribution objects for each suggestion.
- **Wise import auto-reconciliation** — `import_wise_transactions` now auto-detects inter-account transfers (TRANSFER-*, BANK_DETAILS_PAYMENT_RETURN-*) after import and checks existing journal entries before confirming, preventing double-counting. New `inter_account_dimension_id` parameter (auto-detected when only one other bank account exists).
- **Shared `buildInterAccountJournalIndex` utility** (`inter-account-utils.ts`) — extracted from bank-reconciliation and wise-import to eliminate duplicate journal-scanning logic

### Fixed
- **Reconciliation type bias** — `reconcile_transactions` and `auto_confirm_exact_matches` now match against both sale and purchase invoices regardless of transaction type. Previously, sale invoice matching was dead code because the API stores all bank transactions as type C.
- **Wise `isJarTransfer` documentation** — clarified why the self-transfer heuristic works (bank registrations use different name variants) and when to use `skip_jar_transfers=false`

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md documentation overhaul**:
  - Documented that transaction `type` field is cosmetic; journal direction is determined by distribution at confirmation time
  - Documented transaction status values (PROJECT/CONFIRMED/VOID) and invalidate→delete workflow
  - Fixed misleading `gross_price` guidance: invoice-level `gross_price`/`vat_price` ARE required; only item-level is auto-computed
  - Added inter-account transfer duplicate risk documentation and mitigation guidance
  - Noted Wise balance ~0.03 EUR discrepancy (root cause pending)
- Exported `matchScore` and `normalizeCompanyName` from bank-reconciliation for reuse
- **90 tools**, 10 prompts, 12 resources
- **396 tests** total (up from 376 in 0.9.0)

### Security
- Hardened API key file loading — restricted to package directories
- Fixed TOCTOU vulnerability in receipt inbox file revalidation
- Bounded reconcile transfer date gap to prevent DoS
- Fixed parent dotenv scanning opt-in
- Fixed `roundMoney` for extreme magnitudes

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Inter-account transfer reconciliation** — new `reconcile_inter_account_transfers` tool matches and confirms own-account-to-own-account bank transfers (e.g. LHV↔Wise). DUPLICATE-SAFE: checks existing journal entries before confirming, preventing double-booking when the other side was already confirmed via CAMT import. Supports Phase 1 (paired C↔D matching) and Phase 2 (one-sided transfers by IBAN/company name). Dry run by default.
- **4 new MCP prompts** (10 total, up from 6):
  - `receipt-batch`: guided receipt folder scan with preview and explicit approval before booking
  - `import-wise`: Wise CSV transaction import workflow with fee account selection and dry-run preview
  - `import-camt`: CAMT.053 bank statement import workflow with duplicate detection guidance
  - `classify-unmatched`: unmatched bank transaction classification and batch-apply workflow
- **4 new Claude Code commands** (`.claude/commands/`): `receipt-batch`, `import-wise`, `import-camt`, `classify-unmatched` — matching the new MCP prompts
- **4 new workflow guides** (`workflows/`): editor-agnostic runbooks for the new prompts
- **Wise Jar filtering** — Wise import now recognizes and filters Jar (savings pot) transfers so they don't create spurious bank transactions
- **Wise multi-currency handling** — target fee amount/currency and source name fields now parsed from CSV; currency detection improved for non-EUR transactions
- **.env.example** added with all configurable environment variables documented

### Fixed
- **Booking approval safeguard**: `book-invoice` prompt and command now require explicit user approval of a booking preview before creating the purchase invoice — prevents silent mis-bookings
- **Connection switching safety**: race guard error message now warns about inspecting side effects; `requestGuard()` added to block API requests after mid-tool connection changes
- **Diacritics in reconciliation matching**: `normalizeCompanyName()` strips diacritics (ü→u, ö→o, etc.) for consistent fuzzy name matching across bank reconciliation and inter-account transfers
- **Invoice number prefix nullability**: `number_prefix` concatenation no longer produces `"undefined123"` when prefix is null
- **Wise import edge cases**: direction normalization handles case variations; fee rows use correct target fee currency; preview metadata includes currency info
- **OCR hardening**: default integration checks enabled; document parser handles edge cases more robustly
- **`.env` loading**: explicit `loadDotenvFiles()` call at startup ensures environment variables are available before config loading
- **Allowed roots startup warning**: `getAllowedRootsStartupWarning()` now runs at server start and logs a warning if `EARVELDAJA_ALLOWED_PATHS` is set to filesystem root

### Changed
- **Receipt inbox refactored** into three focused modules:
  - `receipt-extraction.ts` (1318 lines): regex-based field extraction, VAT detection, supplier inference, classification logic
  - `supplier-resolution.ts` (176 lines): Levenshtein-based supplier matching, country inference, counterparty normalization
  - `receipt-inbox.ts`: orchestration layer importing from the above
- **Prompt accuracy improvements**:
  - `book-invoice` step numbering updated for the new approval checkpoint (steps 11→14)
  - `reconcile-bank` prompt includes Phase 4 for inter-account transfers with duplicate safety workflow
  - `company-overview` prompt steps parallelized for faster execution
  - `new-supplier` command updated with safer resolution workflow
  - Server instructions updated with inter-account transfer guidance and approval checkpoint in document flow
- **CSV parsing**: Wise import switched from line-by-line `parseCSVLine` to full `parseCSV` for correct multi-line field handling
- **Code deduplication**: keyword lookup deduplicated, journal data preloaded, types narrowed across multiple modules
- **Test coverage improvements**: bank reconciliation tests (46), Wise import tests (27), prompt content validation tests, config tests, integration connection tests hardened
- **89 tools**, 10 prompts, 12 resources
- **376 tests** total (up from 325 in 0.8.0)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- **README improvements**:
  - Added batch receipt processing usage example
  - Added CAMT.053 bank statement import usage example (LHV, Swedbank, SEB, Coop, Luminor)
  - Added Estonian tax tools usage examples (dividends, owner expense reimbursement)
  - Added "Good to know" section: dry-run defaults, 200-page pagination limit, caching behavior, EUR default, multi-company switching
  - Added privacy note clarifying that local OCR is used but extracted text flows through the connected LLM

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Local document parsing with LiteParse** — PDF, JPG, and PNG invoice documents are now parsed locally using `@llamaindex/liteparse` with built-in Tesseract OCR (Estonian + English). No external service required.
  - Configurable via environment variables: `EARVELDAJA_LITEPARSE_OCR_ENABLED`, `EARVELDAJA_LITEPARSE_OCR_LANGUAGE`, `EARVELDAJA_LITEPARSE_OCR_SERVER_URL`, `EARVELDAJA_LITEPARSE_NUM_WORKERS`, `EARVELDAJA_LITEPARSE_MAX_PAGES`
- **Invoice extraction fallback** — when deterministic regex extraction is incomplete, `extract_pdf_invoice` returns structured `llm_fallback` hints alongside `raw_text` so the LLM can fill gaps from the full document text
- **Document identifier extraction** — dedicated `src/document-identifiers.ts` module for extracting Estonian registry codes, VAT numbers, IBANs (with ISO 7064 mod-97 validation), and reference numbers from OCR text
- **144 new unit tests** (181 → 325 total across 32 test files):
  - `financial-statements.test.ts` (34): balance computation, contra-accounts, trial balance, balance sheet, P&L, month-end close, leap year
  - `account-balance.test.ts` (14): D/C direction, date filters, client filter, multi-currency
  - `aging-analysis.test.ts` (16): bucket boundaries, due-date edge cases, `base_gross_price` fallback
  - `estonian-tax.test.ts` (21): 22/78 CIT arithmetic, retained earnings, net-assets §157, VAT branching
  - `document-identifiers.test.ts` (26): registry codes, VAT numbers, IBAN mod-97 validation, reference numbers
  - `csv.test.ts` (7): quoted fields, escaped double-quotes, custom delimiters
  - `base-resource.test.ts` (20): pagination cap, cache invalidation, namespace isolation
  - `account-validation.test.ts` (6): missing/inactive accounts, deduplication

### Fixed
- **Security hardening**:
  - Updated `fast-xml-parser` to fix entity expansion bypass (GHSA-jp2q-39xq-3w4g) — 0 npm audit vulnerabilities
  - `EARVELDAJA_ALLOWED_PATHS` now warns when set to filesystem root `/`
  - OCR server URL (`EARVELDAJA_LITEPARSE_OCR_SERVER_URL`) validated for http/https protocol to prevent SSRF
  - `toolError()` inspect depth reduced to 2 and output truncated to 500 chars to limit information disclosure
  - Stack trace logging demoted from stderr to MCP debug level
  - `getAllowedRoots()` deduplicated — single source of truth in `file-validation.ts` (removed duplicate from `receipt-inbox.ts`)
  - `resolveFilePath()` exported from `file-validation.ts` (removed duplicate `resolveInputPath` from `receipt-inbox.ts`)
- **Error handling**: all `catch (err: any)` blocks converted to `catch (err: unknown)` with safe `err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)` pattern in `wise-import.ts` and `recurring-invoices.ts`
- **Cache consistency**: `sendEinvoice()` now calls `invalidateCache()` before the API call, matching every other mutating method
- **Type safety**: removed unnecessary `(inv as any).payment_status` cast in `bank-reconciliation.ts`; removed dead `if (vat !== undefined || gross !== undefined)` guard in `purchase-invoices.api.ts`
- **Prompt accuracy**:
  - `book-invoice` step cross-references fixed (steps 5 and 11, not 4 and 10)
  - `lightyear-booking` account parameters changed from `z.string()` to `z.number()` to match actual tool schemas
  - `month-end-close` duplicate detection step clarified (scans all suppliers, explains `exact_duplicates` vs `suspicious_same_amount_date`)
  - `reconcile-bank` mode description clarified as numeric transaction ID
- **Receipt inbox reliability**:
  - VAT extraction and supplier name detection improved for OCR edge cases (split lines, Estonian text, mixed formats)
  - Auto-booking accuracy improved for domestic expenses and foreign supplier reverse-charge detection
  - Currency detection and amount extraction hardened against malformed OCR output

### Changed
- **New dependency**: `@llamaindex/liteparse` ^1.0.0 for local document parsing
- **88 tools**, 6 prompts, 12 resources (unchanged from 0.7.x; corrected from previously overcounted README)
- **325 tests** total (up from 133 in 0.7.1)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **MCP prompt accuracy**:
  - aligned `book-invoice`, `reconcile-bank`, `month-end-close`, `new-supplier`, `company-overview`, and `lightyear-booking` with the real tool names, parameter names, and output shapes
  - fixed stale prompt guidance that previously referred to invalid fields such as `query`, `client_id`, `invoice_id`/`id` mixups, `start_date`/`end_date`, and `dry_run` flags where tools now expect `execute`
  - improved Lightyear guidance around `gain_loss_account`, `tax_account`, dimensions, and preview/execute flow so prompts no longer encourage half-configured bookings
- **Server instructions**:
  - updated the global MCP instructions to match the corrected purchase-invoice and bank-reconciliation workflows

### Changed
- **Prompt regression coverage**:
  - expanded prompt tests from name-only registration checks to content checks that validate the generated workflow text against actual tool schemas
- **133 tests** total, up from 128 in v0.7.0
- **Release metadata** updated to `0.7.1`

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Recurring invoice safety**:
  - `create_recurring_sale_invoices` is now idempotent for reruns by marking created clones and skipping already-created target-period copies
  - auto-confirm failures are now counted and reported as errors instead of being folded into success-only output
- **Wise import retry behavior**:
  - missing fee rows can now be backfilled on rerun even when the main Wise transaction already exists
  - fee rows are no longer created if main transaction creation fails, preventing orphan fee entries
- **Runtime config discovery**:
  - `EARVELDAJA_SCAN_PARENT=true` now applies to `.env` loading as well as `apikey*.txt` discovery

### Removed
- **KMD workflow prompt**:
  - removed the MCP KMD/VAT-declaration prompt and related documentation as unnecessary, because e-arveldaja already handles KMD declarations in its own product
  - prompt surface is now back to **6 MCP prompts**

### Changed
- **Test coverage**:
  - regression tests added for recurring invoice idempotency and confirm-error reporting, Wise partial-import recovery, parent `.env` discovery, and prompt registration
- **128 tests** total, up from 122 in v0.6.0
- **Release metadata** updated to `0.7.0`

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Receipt inbox and expense auto-booking** — 4 new tools:
  - `scan_receipt_folder`: scan a folder for receipt PDFs/images without recursing
  - `process_receipt_batch`: extract, classify, book, and bank-match receipt files in one pass (`execute=false` by default)
  - `classify_unmatched_transactions`: classify unreconciled bank transactions into expense-like and review-only categories
  - `apply_transaction_classifications`: batch-apply those classifications as purchase invoices and transaction links
- **MCP compatibility layer**:
  - new `src/mcp-compat.ts` bridges legacy `tool/prompt/resource` registrations to SDK `registerTool` / `registerPrompt` / `registerResource`
  - resource and tool registrations now preserve first-class MCP titles through the compatibility wrapper

### Fixed
- **Receipt inbox booking and totals**:
  - auto-booked purchase invoices now preserve explicit gross/VAT totals correctly during confirm
  - domestic expense auto-booking no longer overstates net/gross amounts
  - reverse-charge handling and foreign supplier detection were corrected for imported receipts and transaction classifications
  - small incoming bank movements no longer fall into the `bank_fees` auto-booking bucket
- **Runtime config lookup**:
  - `.env` and `apikey*.txt` are now resolved from the working directory as well, fixing `npx` / installed-package MCP setups that previously looked in the wrong place
- **MCP reliability and protocol behavior**:
  - tool and resource handlers are pinned to a connection snapshot, so `switch_connection` cannot race resource reads onto the wrong company
  - tool-level validation and business errors now return proper MCP `isError: true` results
  - `import_wise_transactions` now skips duplicate main and fee rows both by `WISE:{id}` markers and by a legacy date/amount/counterparty/reference signature, preventing re-imports when older rows lack the newer description prefix
  - `create_recurring_sale_invoices` creates invoices again by default; preview mode is now explicit via `dry_run=true`, and the tool description matches the actual behavior
  - `toolError()` now handles `undefined`, circular objects, and other non-JSON-serializable throws without failing inside the error wrapper
- **Release metadata drift**:
  - package metadata and lockfile root version are now aligned again

### Changed
- **MCP metadata and SDK usage**:
  - prompts, resources, and tools now register through the modern SDK registration path via the compatibility layer
  - file/folder-input tools now advertise `openWorldHint=true`, including PDF import/upload, Lightyear CSV tools, Wise import, receipt-folder tools, and CAMT.053 parse/import
  - prompt/resource listings now carry first-class titles consistently
- **Documentation and assistant guidance**:
  - README and Claude guidance were updated for the newer MCP workflow and dry-run semantics
- **96 tools** total (up from 90 in v0.5.0).
- **122 tests** total (up from 88 in v0.5.0) — added focused regression coverage for receipt inbox flows, config lookup, purchase invoice totals, recurring invoice execution defaults, Wise duplicate detection, file-input metadata flags, MCP compat behavior, and robust tool error serialization

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Annual report automation** — 3 new tools (1137 lines):
  - `prepare_year_end_close`: analyze fiscal year, propose closing entries and accruals, detect unresolved items (dry_run by default)
  - `generate_annual_report_data`: map trial balance to Estonian RTJ micro/small entity format — bilanss (balance sheet), kasumiaruanne (income statement Schema 1), rahavoogude aruanne (cash flow, indirect method), key financial ratios, and notes data
  - `execute_year_end_close`: create closing journal entries with explicit confirmation, duplicate detection, and draft-only safety
- **CAMT.053 bank statement import** — 2 new tools (669 lines):
  - `parse_camt053`: read-only XML parsing with metadata, entries, and duplicate detection by bank reference (AcctSvcrRef)
  - `import_camt053`: batch import as bank transactions (dry_run by default), auto-resolves counterparties by registry code/name, maps CRDT→D/DBIT→C
  - Supports all Estonian banks (LHV, Swedbank, SEB, Coop, Luminor) via ISO 20022 camt.053.001.02 format
  - Handles batched entries (multi-NtryDtls), mixed-currency transactions, proportional amount splitting
- **New dependency**: `fast-xml-parser` v5 for CAMT.053 XML parsing with `processEntities: false` (XXE defense-in-depth)

### Fixed
- **`roundMoney` now correct at ALL magnitudes.** Replaced EPSILON approach with string exponent trick (`parseFloat(abs + "e2")`), which bypasses IEEE 754 intermediate multiplication errors. Correctly handles 0.005, 1.005, 10000.005, 999999.995, negatives, -0, NaN, Infinity.
- **Annual report equity mapping** — dynamically sums all `Omakapital` accounts instead of hardcoding 3000/3010/3200. Correctly handles post-close scenario by excluding YECL closing journals from P&L computation.
- **CAMT multi-NtryDtls** — batched payment entries are no longer silently dropped; all transaction details are flattened and split proportionally.
- **CAMT mixed-currency** — uses entry-level booked amount (account currency), not TxAmt/InstdAmt (original currency).
- **HTTP retry safety** — retries limited to GET+429 only for 5xx; all methods retry on 429. Auth headers regenerated fresh on each retry attempt.
- **`vat_rate_dropdown` number crash** — coerced to String() before `.replace()` in purchase invoice normalization, preventing TypeError when LLM passes a number.
- **Lightyear `total_invested_eur`** — replaced last `Math.round(x*100)/100` with `roundMoney()`.
- **XMLParser** `processEntities: false` for defense-in-depth against entity expansion.
- **`as Transaction` unsafe cast** removed in CAMT import, replaced with proper partial type.
- **`as any` casts** removed in `wise-import.ts`, `catch (err: any)` → `catch (err: unknown)`.
- **Multi-statement CAMT** error message now suggests splitting the file.

### Changed
- **90 tools** total (up from 85 in v0.4.0).
- **88 tests** total (up from 79 in v0.4.0) — new tests for annual report equity/closing, CAMT multi-entry/currency, HTTP retry, roundMoney edge cases.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: `roundMoney` IEEE 754 half-cent rounding bug.** `Math.round(v * 100) / 100` misrounded at half-cent boundaries (e.g. `1.005` → `1.00` instead of `1.01`). Now uses sign-aware EPSILON approach. Affects all VAT calculations, gross prices, and balance aggregations.
- **Purchase invoice VAT normalization.** `confirmWithTotals()` now also repairs mismatched `vat_price` (previously only checked `gross_price`). `createAndSetTotals()` now PATCHes totals for zero-value and negative invoices (credit notes).
- **Cache invalidation race on connection switch.** Generation counter now increments *before* clearing caches, and both old and new connection caches are cleared to prevent stale data.
- **Bank reconciliation double-match.** `consumedInvoiceKeys` is now added *after* successful confirmation, not before — failed confirms no longer block the invoice from later matching.
- **`Cache.set(key, data, 0)` TTL bug.** Zero TTL previously used the 300s default (falsy check); now correctly skips storage.

### Added
- **HTTP retry with exponential backoff.** 429/5xx/network errors are retried up to 3 times with 1s/2s/4s backoff.
- **Currency parameter on `create_purchase_invoice_from_pdf`.** No longer hardcoded to EUR; defaults to EUR if omitted.
- **`CreatePurchaseInvoiceData` type** in `types/api.ts` — replaces `as any` casts in purchase invoice creation.
- **`base_amount` field** added to `Transaction` interface for multi-currency reconciliation.
- **Date format validation** on Zod params: `YYYY-MM-DD` regex on journal/invoice/transaction date fields, `YYYY-MM` on month-end checklist.
- **New shared utilities:** `src/paths.ts` (project root), `src/csv.ts` (CSV line parser), `src/account-validation.ts` (account existence checks).
- **New tests:** HTTP client retry logic, CSV parsing, account validation (79 total, up from 76).

### Changed
- **Reduced `as any` casts** across 6 files: `transactions.api.ts`, `crud-tools.ts`, `pdf-workflow.ts`, `bank-reconciliation.ts`, `purchase-invoices.api.ts`, `wise-import.ts`. Replaced with proper typed generics and interfaces.
- **Deduplicated code:** `getProjectRoot()` extracted to `paths.ts` (was in `config.ts` + `file-validation.ts`), `parseCSVLine()` extracted to `csv.ts` (was in `lightyear-investments.ts` + `wise-import.ts`), `checkAccount()` consolidated in `account-validation.ts` (was in `estonian-tax.ts` + `lightyear-investments.ts`).
- **`month_end_close_checklist` parallelized:** 4 sequential `listAll()` calls replaced with `Promise.all()`.
- **`wrapHandler` error logging:** Full stack trace now logged to stderr before converting to MCP tool error.
- **18 files changed, 4 new files, -33 net lines.**

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **Server instructions** restructured into sections (Purchase invoices / Bank reconciliation / Reporting) for clearer LLM guidance.
- **25 tool titles and descriptions improved** based on Codex review: more specific naming (e.g. "Find Client by Registry Code", "Extract Supplier Invoice PDF", "Compute Client Net Position"), clearer action descriptions, consistent terminology.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Server instructions**: Global cross-tool guidance for LLMs — PDF workflow order, VAT checking, dry-run defaults, reverse charge rules. Injected via MCP `instructions` field.
- **Tool titles**: All 85 tools have human-readable `title` annotations for better client UI rendering.
- **Progress notifications**: MCP `notifications/progress` emitted during multi-page fetches (`listAll`), bank auto-confirmation, Wise import, and Lightyear trade booking.

### Changed
- Simplified README setup: leads with "ask your AI assistant" approach, one-liner `claude mcp add`, collapsible details for manual config. MCP prompts highlighted as primary workflow mechanism.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **MCP tool annotations** on all 85 tools: `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`. Clients can auto-approve read-only tools and require confirmation for destructive ones.
- **6 MCP prompts**: `book-invoice`, `reconcile-bank`, `month-end-close`, `new-supplier`, `company-overview`, `lightyear-booking`. Client-agnostic workflow templates (unlike `.claude/commands/` which only work in Claude Code).
- **6 dynamic resource templates**: `earveldaja://clients/{id}`, `products/{id}`, `journals/{id}`, `sale_invoices/{id}`, `purchase_invoices/{id}`, `transactions/{id}`. Direct resource access by ID.
- **Structured error responses**: All tools return `{ isError: true }` on failure instead of throwing, letting clients distinguish tool errors from protocol errors.
- **MCP protocol logging**: Configurable logger (`src/logger.ts`) that uses MCP `sendLoggingMessage` after connection, with stderr fallback during startup.
- **Journal invalidation** (`invalidate_journal`): Reverse a confirmed journal entry back to editable state.
- **Shared `roundMoney()` utility** (`src/money.ts`): Consistent 2-decimal rounding across all monetary calculations.
- **`listAll()` progress logging**: Logs page count to stderr/MCP when fetching multi-page datasets.

### Changed
- **`number_suffix` optional** on `create_sale_invoice`: Omit for auto-assign from invoice series.
- **`reconcile_transactions`** now fetches all pages (was single-page only).
- **`fee_account_relation_id` required** on `import_wise_transactions`: No more hardcoded default; use `list_account_dimensions` to find the correct ID.
- **Renamed** `delete_client` → `deactivate_client`, `delete_product` → `deactivate_product` to match actual behavior (soft-delete, reversible).
- **Connection-scoping proxy** replaces fragile `server.tool` monkey-patching. Forward-compatible with any MCP SDK overload changes.
- **`safeJsonParse`** exported from `crud-tools.ts`; duplicate in `pdf-workflow.ts` removed.
- **Allowed path roots** in file validation now resolve symlinks (fixes `/tmp` → `/private/tmp` on macOS).
- **Standardized logging**: `console.warn`/`console.error` replaced with `process.stderr.write` or MCP logger.

### Fixed
- **Floating-point money**: 60+ inline `Math.round(x * 100) / 100` replaced with shared `roundMoney()`.
- **`(invoice as any)` casts** in `purchase-invoices.api.ts` replaced with proper `PurchaseInvoiceDetail` type.
- **Redundant branch** in `normalizeVatRate`: both sides of a ternary were identical.
- **Unused `idParam`** removed from `BaseResource` constructor and all subclasses.
- **Version mismatch**: `index.ts` said `1.0.0` while `package.json` said `0.2.1`.
- **Duplicate account lookup** in `computeAccountBalance`: account info now fetched once in parallel with journals.
- **Recurring invoices** missing `number_suffix` field (could produce empty-numbered invoices).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Reverse charge VAT** (`reversed_vat_id: 1`): Book-invoice skill and workflow now always check if supplier is outside Estonia and set reverse charge accordingly. Prevents missing pöördkäibemaks on foreign invoices.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Wise transaction import** (`import_wise_transactions`): Parse Wise transaction-history.csv and create bank transactions. Fees as separate entries auto-confirmed to expense account 8610. Duplicate detection by Wise ID. Dry run by default.
- **Transaction invalidate** (`invalidate_transaction`): Unconfirm confirmed bank transactions for editing or deletion.
- **Accounting workflow skills** (`.claude/commands/`): `/book-invoice`, `/reconcile-bank`, `/month-end`, `/new-supplier`
- **Generic workflow guides** (`workflows/`): Editor-agnostic runbooks for all workflows, usable with any MCP client.
- **401 troubleshooting**: Shows public IP and setup instructions when API authentication fails.
- **npm publishing**: Available via `npx -y e-arveldaja-mcp`.

### Changed
- README rewritten to be editor-agnostic: setup instructions for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline.
- API key placement instructions clarified for working directory context.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Initial npm release with 84 MCP tools across 11 modules.
- **CRUD tools**: Clients, products, journals, transactions, sale invoices, purchase invoices, reference data.
- **PDF workflow**: Extract invoice text, validate data, resolve supplier, suggest booking, create purchase invoice from PDF, upload documents.
- **Bank reconciliation**: Match unconfirmed transactions to invoices with confidence scoring, auto-confirm exact matches.
- **Financial statements**: Trial balance, balance sheet, profit & loss, month-end close checklist.
- **Aging analysis**: Receivables and payables aging buckets.
- **Account balances**: D/C balance computation, client debt.
- **Document audit**: Missing documents detection, duplicate invoice detection.
- **Recurring invoices**: Clone sale invoices for recurring billing.
- **Estonian tax**: Dividend package preparation, owner expense reimbursement.
